If the name causes you psychological suffering, drop alternate name suggestions below:

**ManipulAI** is an AI-driven solution which could detect and analyze bias, misinformation, and propaganda in content(s) provided by the user. Through Hugging Face models `emotion-english-distilroberta-basetoxic-bert` and `Minej/bert-base-personality`, the system will be able to identify patterns that implies biased or misleading narratives. 

## Purpose/Description 
ManipulAI aims to empower users with tools to help differentiate between objective truth and false narratives throughout various forms of content. 

## Tech Stack 

### Programming Language 
- HTML
- Javascript
- Python
  
### Librarires and Frameworks
- Transformers
- PyTorch

## Future Plans
- **Contextual Analysis**: Incorporate background context to content that user provides so that our AI has a higher accurarcy in distinguishing between objectively truth and biased or misleading information. This will increase AI's accurarcy and make it more relevant for real-world scenarios.
- **Database Expansion**: Expand our model's database to expose our AI to more diverse bias, misinformation, and propaganda techniques.
- **Feedback Loop**: Have users be able to validate AI's analysis on a content in order to continously improve the model's performance

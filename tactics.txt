Here we can put research into the tactics used for propaganda/persuasion/maniupulation/I'm going to stop writing almost-synonyms because I don't know how to describe this/I'm tired

Please categorize the information you add for clarity's sake (see above point about tired)

Tactic 1: Create and emotional response in the reader rather than a rational one
    - "Loaded" language -- hyperbole, emotional vocabularity
    - Demonizing an enemy or hero-izing a (usually political) figure
        - Attempt to raise levels of anger and admriation
        - Pejorative name-calling

Tactic 2: Reduce trust in reliable sources

Tactic 3: Vague, logically meaningless statements that "sound good"
    - Overuse of words, phrases and symbols related to values of the country, e.g. "freedom", a flag of the country (although the symbols may be more visual than text)
        - Attempting to relate the speaker to the symbols, basically transfering their meaning onto the person
    - Subjective statements presented as fact


Tactic 4: "Card-stacking" or telling only one side fo the story, emphasizing good qualities while omitting bad

Tactic 5: Bandwagon/grouping people
    - Encouraging groupthink to stop people from thinking critically
    - "Evereyone else is doing it" kind of persuasion

Other:
    - Celebrity testimonials + name-dropping
    - Appealing to "plain-folk"/claiming you're just like your followers (without backing up the claim)

A 2010 run for US senate collapsed amid images of private jets and million-dollar yachts . Now , she hopes the revived record of a dot-com businesswoman will vault her over the otherwise all-male Republican field of mostly professional politicians \u2013 or at least lead to a spot as one of their vice-presidential running mates to face Hillary Clinton head-on .\n\u201c We went from a market laggard to market leader , \u201d Fiorina has said of her six years running the computer giant . \u201c Unlike Hillary , I have actually accomplished something . \u201d\nIs Carly Fiorina the GOP 's best hope of damaging Hillary Clinton ? Read more\nBut those who watched what Fiorina did to HP \u2013 mishandling the $ 25bn acquisition of Compaq , getting ousted by the board in 2005 with a $ 21m golden parachute , repeatedly being named one of the worst CEOs in American corporate history \u2013 say those supposed accomplishments are already coming back to \u201c haunt \u201d her run for the White House .\n\u201c She put herself ahead of the interests of the company and I fear she would do the same as president , \u201d Jason Burnett , a grandson of the late HP co-founder David Packard and a member of the Packard Foundation board of trustees , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c I don \u2019 t want her to do harm to this country . \u201d\nHP \u2019 s longtime director of corporate communications , Roy Verley , said his ex-boss alienated colleagues with a \u201c cult of Carly \u201d that put self-promotion first .\n\u201c She didn \u2019 t know what she was doing and couldn \u2019 t deliver on her promises , \u201d said Verley , who left HP in 2000 .\nThe notion of a successful Fiorina reign at HP , he said , was \u201c fantasy \u201d .\nBurnett , echoing criticisms from more Hewletts and Packards alike , warned the emergent class of political bankrollers in Silicon Valley \u2013 already courted by Fiorina \u2019 s competitors like Rand Paul and Jeb Bush and soon Clinton herself\u2013 to \u201c refresh their memory \u201d before signing campaign checks .\nLeslie Shedd , press secretary for Carly for America , defended Fiorina \u2019 s tenure at HP , saying she doubled revenue , tripled innovation , quadrupled cash flow and bequeathed a stronger company .\n\u201c Under Carly \u2019 s leadership , HP weathered the 2001 economic recession that shuttered some of the top tech companies in Silicon Valley , \u201d Shedd said . \u201c Carly Fiorina made the tough decisions that were necessary to reform the company , and HP and its shareholders reaped the rewards of those decisions after she left . \u201d\nShedd cited tech players such as investor Tom Perkins and Craig Barrett , former Chairman of the board at Intel , who defended Fiorina \u2019 s handling of the Compaq merger .\nShe said Fiorina had had to deal with a \u201c dysfunctional \u201d board at HP and disputed the credibility of lists ranking her boss as one of America \u2019 s worst CEOs .\n\u201c Those lists are based on no metrics , \u201d Shedd said , \u201c are completely the opinion of whomever is compiling the list , and are nothing other than gossip . \u201d\nBut political scientists and technology bankrollers agreed that even a woman-focused , folksy-outsider-meets-business-insider campaign would struggle to shrug off cobwebby boardroom battles predating the Facebook era and re-emerge as much more than a longshot .\n\u201c She takes the Silicon Valley motto that it \u2019 s \u2018 OK to fail \u2019 a tad too literally , \u201d wrote the usually sober editorial board of the San Jose Mercury News , in calling for more women in politics \u2013 except Carly Fiorina .\nLittle of Fiorina \u2019 s boom-and-bust time at HP appears to have registered in the Republican heartland , where she has been working on an invisible campaign for months , touting her ostensibly humble origins and an only-in-America backstory .\nThe Texas-born daughter of an artist and a federal judge , she studied philosophy and medieval history at Stanford and worked as a secretary and receptionist before joining AT & T as a trainee manager .\nFiorina zoomed up the ranks , and in 1999 , HP poached her to become the first woman to lead a Fortune 50 company . The pay , perks and egalitarian ethos elicited fierce employee loyalty , but the Silicon Valley behemoth needed a bold new leader .\nThat is often where Fiorina \u2019 s Horatio Alger-style narrative ends on the campaign trail , and where the pro-life , pro-guns , pro-God social conservatism begins .\nFrom Iron Lady to # GrandmothersKnowBest : Hillary Clinton is playing the 'gender card ' to win Read more\nWhile insisting that Clinton \u201c can \u2019 t play the gender card \u201d against her , Fiorina has further burnished her conservative appeal by challenging the Democratic frontrunner \u2019 s credentials .\n\u201c She has not accomplished much , \u201d Fiorina said of the former secretary of state at a campaign stop last month in Iowa . \u201c I have sat across the table from Vladimir Putin . \u201d\n\u201c Obviously I \u2019 ve never negotiated a nuclear deal with Iran , \u201d she said at a recent breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor . \u201c But I \u2019 ve negotiated a lot of deals . \u201d\nThe dual appeal \u2013 \u201c I \u2019 m not a political neophyte , but I \u2019 m also not a professional politician \u201d \u2013 appears to have won over voters in early battleground states such as Iowa and New Hampshire . But an Associated Press poll released over the weekend suggests she may have many deals yet to make : just 7 % of those surveyed had a favourable view of Fiorina , and a full three-quarters said they did not know enough about her .\n\u201c People out there are not troubled by the fact I have not held elected office , \u201d Fiorina told a conservative audience in Washington on Saturday .\nEven if Fiorina \u2019 s presidential run ends as a way to the vice-presidency , campaign-watchers say her six years at HP will shape voter perceptions : \u201c And not to her advantage , \u201d said Melinda Jackson , a politics professor at San Jose state university . \u201c It was a rocky tenure . I think it will haunt her . \u201d\nCritics recall that HP \u2019 s board accused her of \u201c destroying \u201d the company \u2019 s value by mishandling the Compaq takeover , a move that committed HP to making low-margin personal computers rather than focusing on higher-margin products such as printers .\nThe company was sued by its shareholders , who argued she didn \u2019 t deserve such a massive severance package . Ben Rosen , the former chairman of Compaq , said Fiorina \u201c simply did not have the skills to manage one of the world \u2019 s largest technology companies \u201d .\nUnder Fiorina , HP revenue more than doubled \u2013 from $ 42bn in sales to $ 87bn \u2013 but net earnings fell to $ 2.4bn from $ 3.1bn .\nThe Unlocking Potential Project , Fiorina \u2019 s new initiative to help close the gender gap and recruit more independent women backers , describes her achievements at HP as including \u201c market leadership in every market and product category and quadruple cash-flow \u201d . But HP stock tumbled 50 % during her tenure \u2013 and leaped 6.9 % the day after her departure .\nBurnett , the Packard grandson , said those financial realities create a dilemma for an ardent advocate of a free market advocate : \u201c What can she say ? The market was mistaken ? \u201d\nFive years after the ouster , when Fiorina began her first bid for public office and challenged Barbara Boxer for her California senate seat , his sister Arianna wrote a letter . Fiorina , the heiress warned three Republican senators who had endorsed the former CEO , was spinning her record at HP \u2013 and Arianna Packard accused her of using the golden parachute for \u201c financing her campaign \u201d .\n\u201c [ A ] llow me to disillusion you of a few of your stated reasons for supporting her , \u201d Packard wrote . \u201c Most business commentators consider Fiorina \u2019 s tenure at HP to be a disaster . \u201d\nBoxer defeated Fiorina resoundingly , thanks in large part to devastating attack ads .\nOne intoned : \u201c As CEO of HP , Carly Fiorina laid off 30,000 workers . Fiorina shipped jobs to China . And while Californians lost their jobs , Fiorina tripled her salary , bought a million-dollar yacht and five corporate jets ... Carly Fiorina . Outsourcing jobs . Out for herself . \u201d\nRepublican rivals for the 2016 nominating fight may borrow that playbook from 2010 , said Bill Whalen , a Hoover Institution research fellow who advises California \u2019 s top Republicans .\n\u201c I can see a Super Pac doing the same to her in the primary , \u201d Whalen said . \u201c Hers is not an easy story to tell . \u201d\nAfter spending last week in New Hampshire , Fiorina will roll out her candidacy via social media on Monday , followed by media interviews , a campaign booklet called \u201c My Leadership Journey \u201d and an address to the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in New York , where she will seek to regain confidence from a startup world she left behind on the wrong side of a bubble .\nBut her bid for the White House is already being cast by many politicos as a bid for redemption , to banish the ignominy from her HP departure . Activists and donors are watching closely to see if she can still lure campaign financing out of a \u201c Carly for America \u201d fundraising operation already drawing scrutiny from federal officials .\n\u201c I was in junior high ; I don \u2019 t know what happened at HP , \u201d said Aaron Ginn , the co-founder of San Francisco-based Lincoln Labs , a lobbying group that enlists an increasingly influential \u2013 and rich \u2013 group of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs wading into the world of donations with politics that are a blend of socially open-minded libertarianism and new-school Republicanism .\nSpeaking in a personal capacity , and without endorsing any candidate , Ginn said he liked Fiorina \u2019 s conviction and philosophical underpinnings . He shrugged off the attacks on her as standard electoral fare : \u201c You can find a hater anywhere , \u201d he said .\nCarly Fiorina will lose the Republican nomination to prove there 's no war on women Read more\nBut as the Clintons discovered with Whitewater and now everything from email servers to charitable donations , US presidential campaigns can shine harsh , sustained spotlights on old events . Just ask John Kerry about that swift boat and the Vietnam war .\nFiorina \u2019 s admirers see presidential attributes in the tenacity and confidence of an executive willing to confront the future \u2013 if not quite all of her past .\nHer \u201c incredibly smart , passionate , articulate \u201d qualities shone some years ago , said Carl Guardino , a former HP executive who is now CEO of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group , when she accepted his invitation to address an audience of mostly underprivileged Latina girls .\nVerley , the former communications director at HP , said Fiorina \u2019 s self-confidence may have led to boardroom fiasco and that historical \u201c fantasy \u201d may yet help Fiorina make an impact on the most crowded Republican field in years \u2013 and be a thorn in Clinton \u2019 s side .\n\u201c She \u2019 s a born politician , \u201d he said . \u201c She \u2019 s extremely confident of her ability to step into any situation and command it . \u201d","bias":0}

While this is far from a complete solution , it is something we can do to reduce the harms of firearms , without waiting for Congress to take action . ''\nTwo victims of the recent shooting at the Gilroy Garlic Festival were children from San Jose \u2014 13-year-old Keyla Salazar , and 6-year-old Stephen Romero .\nLiccardo called the idea a `` harm reduction '' approach meant to emulate other models already in effect .\n`` We require motorists to carry automobile insurance , and the insurance industry appropriately encourages and rewards safe driver behavior , '' Liccardo said . `` We tax tobacco consumption both to discourage risky behavior and to make sure non-smokers are not forced to subsidize the substantial public health costs generated by smoking-related illnesses and deaths .

{"id":"TMCOBlr0Ip65CmJO","content":"The opinions expressed by columnists are their own and do not represent the views of Townhall.com .\nThe erupting accusation of `` attempted rape '' against Judge Brett Kavanaugh when he was 17 show just how shameless the Democrats and the `` Facts First '' media have become . They are promoting an accusation when the accuser ca n't remember when or where it happened . That is enough to stop a Supreme Court nomination ?\nThe media\/Democrat message is that the Senate can not have a vote until we get to the bottom of this horrible accusation . Is there anyone following this story who does n't believe they are stalling until after the midterm elections , when they hope to gain one or two seats necessary to defeat Kavanaugh permanently ? The calculation is as cold as the timing was transparent . So where are the media blowing that whistle ?\nLet 's revisit Juanita Broaddrick . She was pursued by the Paula Jones legal team in the fall of 1998 during the impeachment probe of then-President Bill Clinton , who was seeking her testimony about being violently raped by 31-year-old Clinton in Little Rock 's Camelot Hotel on April 25 , 1978 . Back then , the liberal logic was the exact opposite : We ca n't report anything on Broaddrick until after the Senate impeachment trial -- when President Clinton is safe .\nNBC 's Lisa Myers labored to lock down every detail , confirming the date , the place and that both Clinton and Broaddrick were there that day . Broaddrick taped her emotional interview with Myers on Jan. 20 , and she heard it would air on `` Dateline '' on Jan. 29 . But then NBC sat on it until Feb. 24 -- 12 days after the impeachment threat ended . In 2015 , Myers asserted , `` nothing has come up since that story was reported that in any way undercuts what Juanita Broaddrick said . ''\nThat says it all . But with Kavanaugh , NBC rushed to be the first of the Big Three networks to run with this story . It did n't matter whether NBC had verified anything the accuser said . It just acted like the Democrat News Service . It reported that Sen. Dianne Feinstein had a secret letter that said something serious , and that the vote should be delayed .\nThis does look a lot like the dirty trick that Democrats pulled on then-Supreme Court Justice nominee Clarence Thomas in 1991 , when Democrats tried to defeat his nomination after months of investigating him -- except it makes Anita Hill 's accusations look much less serious . `` Attempted rape '' is far heavier than `` he talked about porn to me and asked me on dates . '' When the Hill-Thomas hearings were over , twice as many Americans believed Thomas than Hill . No one had more than a few days to evaluate her credibility . Everyone forgets that , because the media have never stopped honoring her as a `` Rosa Parks '' of sexual harassment .\nDemocrats are at grave risk of a rerun . The Kavanaugh accuser , Christine Blasey Ford , is much more obviously a Democrat than Anita Hill , whom the media tried to paint as religious and even conservative . Ford has donated to the liberal group Act Blue , and apparently to Sen. Bernie Sanders . She signed a letter opposing President Trump 's border policies . The fact that Ford 's accusation is more serious than Hill 's should make the burden of proof heavier .\nThis may be why NBC 's Chuck Todd suggested on the `` Today '' show that perhaps Kavanaugh should just step down and spare himself ( and the Democrats ) . He said : `` I think nothing would surprise me , uh , including him , by the end of the week , if Judge Kavanaugh decides he does n't want to go through this ; it is n't worth it ; he does n't want to -- maybe he can win , but he does n't want an asterisk . I mean , it would n't surprise me if he chose to withdraw and chose to back down . ''\nSo Judge Kavanaugh should quit over an incredibly vague rape accusation without a time or a place , or a corroborating witness other than the one who says she 's making it up .","bias":2}
{"id":"0zEtPpN3ZZzdCbxm","content":"Nine months after belittling the Islamic State as a \u201c JV \u201d terrorist group , President Obama will devote an urgent prime-time address Wednesday to his plan for defeating the suddenly resurgent militants , a strategy that will rely heavily on U.S. partnership with an untested Iraqi government and unproven Syrian rebels .\nIn a speech from the White House at 9 p.m. , Mr. Obama will tell Americans that the Islamic State is now a \u201c high national security priority , \u201d aides said . And the president will try to marshal public and international support for what would likely be a yearslong counterterrorism campaign , launched little more than a year after he declared that the large-scale fight against Islamist terrorism was all but over .\nThe president briefed House and Senate leaders of both parties at the White House on Tuesday , though it didn \u2019 t appear he laid out many specifics . An aide to GOP House Speaker John A. Boehner said the president went over some of the ideas he \u2019 s already floated , and a White House statement Tuesday that Mr. Obama believed he had the power to act without congressional approval angered many on Capitol Hill .\nMr. Obama \u2019 s address will have to reconcile his past statements with his present course of action , analysts said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s going to be a huge challenge for President Obama , version 2014 , to disagree with President Obama , version 2013 , who suggested that we had won the battle against terrorism , \u201d said Danielle Pletka , a foreign policy and defense analyst at the conservative American Enterprise Institute in Washington .\n\u201c With sufficient humility and a genuine strategy , I believe he could persuade the American people of the importance of this mission , \u201d she said . \u201c The question is : Does he have the strategy ? Does he have the humility ? That \u2019 s not entirely clear . \u201d\nSEE ALSO : World religious leaders urge unity in stopping Islamic State\nWhile White House officials underlined that Mr. Obama told the congressional leaders he already has the authority he needs to conduct the kind of operation he will lay out on Wednesday , they said he welcomed a gesture by Congress expressing support for his policy .\nA senior White House official said Mr. Obama asked the congressional leaders to authorize training and equipment for the Syrian opposition before lawmakers depart Washington for midterm election campaigning later this month . In May , Mr. Obama proposed $ 500 million in assistance .\nThat claim of authority doesn \u2019 t sit well with some in Congress , including many Democrats , who say any expansion of attacks must be put up for a vote on Capitol Hill .\n\u201c If the president intends to prolong the military campaign in Iraq or extend it into Syria , he needs to make the case directly to the American people and secure authorization from Congress , \u201d said California Rep. Adam B. Schiff , the ranking Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence .\nTennessee Sen. Bob Corker , the senior Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , also said he thought President Obama should seek congressional \u201c buy-in \u201d on any major new mission , but said he was skeptical of the president \u2019 s intentions .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think he \u2019 s going to ask for that , and I \u2019 m dismayed by that , \u201d Mr. Corker told CNN . \u201c I think most people here want to deal with [ the Islamic State ] in a strong manner that exterminates them . But I think not seeking that approval on the front end is extremely lacking in judgment . \u201d\nMr. Obama approved strikes last month against Islamic State militants , who have made startling gains across broad swaths of Iraq since the spring . The U.S. campaign began on Aug. 8 and totaled 153 strikes as of Tuesday afternoon , all of them in Iraq .\nThe administration \u2019 s plan for fighting the terrorists in Syria will lean on moderate Syrian rebels who are also engaged in a brutal civil war to topple the regime of President Bashar Assad . Mr. Obama hasn \u2019 t said whether he \u2019 ll expand airstrikes into Syria , and he has vowed not to send U.S. combat troops into the fight .\n\u201c Ramping up our assistance to \u2026 elements of the moderate Syrian opposition would have the effect both of taking the fight to [ the Islamic State ] but also taking the fight to the Assad regime , \u201d said White House press secretary Josh Earnest .\nBut vetting the various Syrian rebel groups to find reliable , moderate partners has been a slow and frustrating process for the administration . Adding to that uncertainty , the family of slain U.S. journalist Steven Sotloff said this week that the hostage was sold to the Islamic State by a supposedly moderate Syrian rebel group .\nMr. Obama \u2019 s top counterterrorism adviser , Lisa Monaco , returned from the Middle East Tuesday and told colleagues that she was encouraged by the response from governments in the region to join the fight against the Islamic State . Among the nations most threatened by the militants is Jordan , where The Associated Press reported that the CIA has approached a retired former agency official with close ties to King Abdullah II about setting up a special task force to deal with the threat .\nThe Arab League has called on members to support international efforts against the Islamic State militarily and politically . Arab governments such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar thus far have avoided a prominent role for fear of provoking retaliatory attacks from the Sunni militants who control major regions of both Syria and Iraq .\nThe crosscurrents of the conflict are daunting , with the regimes in Syria and Iran , which are hostile to Washington , also determined foes of the Islamic State movement , and reliable allies for the United States on the ground hard to find .\nNews reports Tuesday indicated that the leader of an ultraconservative Islamic rebel group in Syria was killed Tuesday in a suicide bombing along with others of its top officials , its allies said , thereby weakening the ranks of the country \u2019 s already shaky armed opposition .\nNo group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack that killed Hassan Aboud and other leading members of Ahrar al-Sham , part of the strongest front to challenge the Islamic State . But given that forces loyal to President Bashar Assad \u2019 s government do not typically use suicide bombers , it appeared likely that forces in the murky mix of opposition fighters in Syria \u2019 s 3-year-old civil war were involved , according to The Associated Press .\nMr. Obama , facing crucial midterm elections in which he needs his antiwar base , will also emphasize in his address Wednesday that he doesn \u2019 t envision a campaign in which the U.S. shoulders all of the costs and personnel for the fight , as in the last Iraq war .\n\u201c The president , as much as anyone else , has certainly learned the lessons that are evident from previous military activities in Iraq , \u201d Mr . Earnest said . \u201c It does not serve our interest to put the United States in the position in which we are bearing the load of the responsibility for providing security in the nation of Iraq . \u201d\nJens David Ohlin , a constitutional law specialist at Cornell University Law School , said Mr. Obama \u201c has a huge decision to make . \u201d\n\u201c Does he want to leave the White House as a peacetime president , declaring victory in the war against al Qaeda and returning the country to a sense of normalcy ? \u201d Mr. Ohlin asked . \u201c Or does he want to leave the White House having recommitted the country to another costly military campaign ? He can not have it both ways \u2014 splitting the difference with a combination of airstrikes and promises to avoid mission creep . \u201d","bias":2}

But the country is under siege , so we can not indulge the luxury of being discouraged .\nThis year has been one body blow after another to the nation we love . First , there was the coronavirus , and we thought , `` How can this get any worse ? '' Then came the economic shutdown and the incalculable pain and suffering it brought . Next were the riots , the radicals ' unopposed seizure of a section of Seattle and the maniacal efforts throughout the country to defund the police . Now a series of rulings from the `` conservative '' Supreme Court are wreaking untold havoc on the Constitution and the rule of law .\nIt would n't take a Christian fanatic or an excitable conspiracist to conclude that America is now the target of an intense spiritual onslaught -- brought on by its own rampant descent into decadence .\nThe left has been at war with America as founded for decades , and it has made great progress in transforming our culture and institutions . Leftists are activism-oriented and relentless . They pursue their goals 24\/7 , exhausting their less activist and less calculating opponents , and advance their agenda by sheer attrition .\nBut a more important factor in the left 's success is the depressing naivete of too many conservatives about its ultimate aims . If you underestimate the extremism and determination of your opponents , how can you counter them ?\nPerhaps one silver lining emerging from the Democrats ' enabling of the proliferating lawlessness in America is that unsuspecting patriots are finally awakening to the horrors facing us and the left 's cynical exploitation of them .\nThe virus is n't red or blue , but the left immediately weaponized it against President Donald Trump , their endless efforts to remove him having failed . From the beginning of this scourge , it was obvious they were more interested in demonizing Trump than in defeating the virus .\nThe media and the Democratic Party bludgeoned Trump instead of working with him to combat the virus . They excoriated him for responding too slowly when , had he listened to them , he would n't have implemented his travel bans , which objectively slowed the spread in the United States .\nThey savaged him for defying the medical experts , when he was following their advice at every turn , including in shutting down the economy . Though they have shut the economy down even more severely in their blue-controlled states , they preposterously blamed the inevitable economic downturn on him .\nThough Trump and virtually all of America condemned the senseless killing of George Floyd , the extreme left seized the moment not merely to protest officer misconduct but to condemn the nation for `` systemic racism , '' `` white privilege '' and `` white supremacy . ''\nLeftist activists converted the protests into riots , looting and violence , and Democratic leaders refused to condemn it and instead fanned the flames lit by the organized mob . They have joined the movement to topple monuments and erase all other unpleasant aspects of American history -- as if they never occurred .\nThis is nothing new for the Democratic Party . It was shocking that its key figures dared to publicly support some of the certifiably insane provisions of the Green New Deal -- provisions too fantastical for even infants to endorse . It was surreal that some of their leading presidential candidates openly supported the abolition of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement . But this widespread move to defund the police takes the insanity to French Revolution-crazy levels .\nHow can parents not fear for their kids ' future ? How can an entire political party give itself over to a lawless mob ? How can it condone the systematic suppression of political speech by Hollywood , the corporate left and social media giants ?\nDo rank-and-file liberals want to live in a country whose culture destroys people who wo n't toe the leftist line ? Ironically , it will only be a matter of time before the mob they legitimized will turn on them , as surely as the French revolutionaries turned on their mastermind Maximilien Robespierre . For an unquenchable mob hellbent on eradicating all traditions , systems and laws , nothing is sacred , and no one is immune . Examples already abound . Just ask actor Mark Duplass and author J.K. Rowling . How can anyone be blind to this fascism ? How , indeed , unless we really are witnessing a raging spiritual war .\nNote to conservatives : If you have been casually dismissing leftist extremism , maybe now you will wake up . Ca n't you hear the alarms blaring ?\nToo many on the right also mistakenly believe that this Democratic frenzy and leftist unrest is all based primarily on their contempt for President Donald Trump . He has made them crazy , and they 'll do anything to get rid of him . Then everything will return to normal .\nYes , he makes them crazier , more desperate and more unreasonable -- mainly because he 's fighting them hammer and tongs -- but he did n't make them leftists , and leftists do n't need any prompting to unleash their hell on America . It stands for everything they hate .\nWith or without Trump , their goals remain the same . But without Trump , their chances of finally undoing America immeasurably increase .\nI began this column saying we ca n't afford to be discouraged . We ca n't . But that does n't mean we can afford to be blind to the gravity of the threats we face . Let 's wake up and rededicate ourselves to preventing the destruction of America . Do n't ever lose hope .

The Trump political apparatus didn \u2019 t lift a finger for Stewart . If anything , Stewart drew more mention in the news media for his pro-Confederate statements than his ties to Trump .\nEven so , the story of the night was Stewart \u2019 s shocking strength against someone with vastly more money , name recognition , and appeal to mainstream voters \u2014 suggesting that the Trump effect is alive and well in the state , where he won the primary last year .\nFor mainstream Republicans , it might mean that their turnout models need tweaking , as they consistently underestimate the enthusiasm and turnout of Stewart-style Trump voters . For Gillespie , it means the coming months will likely have to be spent trying to win over voters he assumed would be with him , rather than tacking to the middle against Northam .\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings , in your inbox .

But the primary in Virginia underscored that the party \u2019 s new reality isn \u2019 t so clear-cut .\nWhile some national pundits tried to cast the race as a replay of 2016 \u2019 s Hillary Clinton vs. Bernie Sanders presidential primary \u2014 with Northam playing the role of insider favorite and Perriello as the insurgent \u2014 the fault lines were less clear than that .\nJust as in New Jersey one week earlier \u2014 where Phil Murphy , a former Goldman Sachs executive won the Democratic gubernatorial nomination with the backing of some of Sanders \u2019 biggest allies , including his son \u2014 the endorsement game didn \u2019 t line up along progressive outsider versus moderate insider lines . Neither did the policy platforms : both candidates ran on liberal platforms .\nNortham may have had the support of the entire state Democratic leadership and Perriello may have had backing from Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren , but many prominent local liberals were quick to rally behind the state \u2019 s no . 2 elected official , while the former congressman had the support of many Barack Obama allies .\nA late-breaking endorsement from The Washington Post may have sealed the deal for Northam . Perriello \u2019 s own internal polls showed him dipping 12 points in the week afterward , according to a Democrat close to the campaign .\nLt. Gov . Ralph Northam celebrates his victory in the Democratic primary during an election party in Crystal City , Va. , on June 13 . | AP Photo\nStill , that doesn \u2019 t mean the Democratic Party is finally united and on the same page after its bruising 2016 primary and months of lingering proxy battles between Clinton and Sanders forces . The surprisingly tight race in Virginia suggested that the party simply has a different set of internal questions to resolve . Those include whether simply running with the \u201c insurgent '' label is enough to get the attention of enough voters to cause a real stir , and whether past breaks from party orthodoxy \u2014 like Perriello \u2019 s on abortion and gun control \u2014 are enough to doom a bid .\nOne defining characteristic of the Trump era has been the consistently surprising energy from Democrats eager to oppose him . That \u2019 s true among activists and also in states that have held elections this year . The high Democratic turnout on Tuesday continued a trend that was highlighted last week in New Jersey \u2014 where the party primary attracted higher-than-expected turnout even though the race wasn \u2019 t competitive .\nTuesday \u2019 s vote attracted well over a half-million Democratic votes , blowing past the party \u2019 s last competitive primary in Virginia , when 320,000 Democratic voters showed up .\nMany state political operatives expected that a higher turnout election would swing the election to Perriello , but Northam coasted . And his win included higher-than-expected numbers in regions with more African-American voters , a major question mark heading into the vote .\nThat bodes well for his general election chances . If Democrats are going to mount a comeback in the Trump era , governor 's mansions must be a big part of it .\nVirginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine , who has been facing the prospect of a tough GOP challenge next year , is breathing easier after watching Democrats turn out in such massive numbers while the Republican establishment pick struggled in a much-lower turnout primary .\nAnother big winner not named Northam or Gillespie on Tuesday : Gov . Terry McAuliffe , whose national ambitions got a boost from Northam \u2019 s big win .\nThe governor , a longtime national party operator and former Democratic National Committee chairman , was by far the most prominent outside figure in Northam \u2019 s campaign , featuring heavily in the lieutenant governor \u2019 s rotation of ads .\nA big Northam win suggests that McAuliffe remains popular with the Democratic base , and burnishes the governor \u2019 s stature \u2014 a rejection Tuesday would have diminished his appeal as a 2020 prospect . Given that some among the party \u2019 s more liberal base are likely to regard him skeptically because of his deep ties to the party establishment and his years-long friendship with the Clintons , a strong victory in a battleground state affords him additional national credibility .\nNortham now enters the general election as a favorite over Gillespie , giving McAuliffe a chance to campaign for his legacy while taking his advocacy of redistricting and his campaign work for other Democratic governors nationwide .\nIt \u2019 s worth noting that McAuliffe isn \u2019 t the only one whose 2020 hand looked stronger after Tuesday \u2019 s election : Stewart \u2019 s shock performance gave Trump some luster as well .\nGillespie \u2019 s close call immediately reminded Virginians and political professionals alike of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor \u2019 s stunning loss in his House race three years ago \u2014 another establishment favorite stunned in Virginia by a come-from-nowhere insurgency .\nIn Cantor \u2019 s case , the win by now-Rep. Dave Brat foreshadowed a broader uprising within the party . In Gillespie \u2019 s case , the near-loss in a low-turnout , low-attention race now forces GOP leaders and lawmakers alike to re-evaluate their positioning ahead of 2018 .\nAfter all , if Gillespie \u2014 a former national chairman and Republican stalwart who was forecast to win by at least 20 points \u2014 is vulnerable to an unexpected Trump-inspired challenger , is anyone really safe ?","bias":0}
{"id":"yqJhwH1omCN5QHDu","content":"\u201c This is a marathon , not a sprint , \u201d Sarah Mason , a graduate student in sociology at the University of California Santa Cruz , tells a crowd of several hundred students , wrapping up the fourth day of an unprecedented wildcat strike that has drawn threats of mass dismissal and captured the attention of UC campuses across the state . Using a megaphone , Mason reminds them that LA teachers went on strike for six days last year and Oakland teachers for seven before getting their pay raises . She asks for a show of hands to see how many wanted to continue to picket the following day . Arms shoot up all around her .\nGraduate student employees have been on a work stoppage since February 10 , refusing to teach , hold office hours , or do other work until the university meets their demands for a cost-of-living adjustment ( COLA ) of $ 1,412 a month to help alleviate the rent burden in Santa Cruz , one of the least affordable housing markets in the country . This was an escalation from a grade strike that over 200 graduate students launched on December 9 .\nStrikers have filled the field of patchy grass at the main entrance to campus every day to picket with chants like \u201c Pay us more , \u201d \u201c No COLA , no grades , \u201d and \u201c Spread the strike. \u201d Students have been handing out water , sunscreen , and food . There are medical and legal teams on hand . There \u2019 s music\u2014students banging on percussion instruments in the morning and Latin hip hop blasting out of speakers in the afternoon . There \u2019 s a guy printing wildcat symbols on people \u2019 s T-shirts . Some professors have even held their classes down at the picket line . The vibe has oscillated between palpable activist rage and the buoyancy of a music festival . Grad students , joined by undergraduates in solidarity , have significantly disrupted daily class operations , at times blocking the main entrance to campus by sitting in the middle of the road and linking arms in a well-organized mass direct action that has forced the university to respond .\nOn February 12 , after an hours-long standoff , 17 students were forcibly arrested by over a hundred police officers in full riot gear brought in by the administration from outside the county . The crackdown ended in several injuries . Those arrested were suspended for two weeks . The police brutality at a university that prides itself on progressive values has made headlines and only emboldened the strikers , whose chants now include \u201c Cops off campus , COLA in my bank account ! \u201d\nLast Friday night , UC President Janet Napolitano published a letter threatening to fire students if they don \u2019 t call off the strike , and reiterated the university \u2019 s position that it refuses to negotiate with the students . \u201c To accede to the demands of a group of employees engaged in an unauthorized wildcat strike would undercut the very foundation of an agreement negotiated in good faith by the UAW and ratified by thousands of members across the system . \u201d\nThe university has given them until 11:59 p.m. tonight to submit grades for the previous fall quarter or face dismissal . For international students on a student visa\u2014about 30 people , in all\u2014this is de facto deportation . For teaching assistants who are parents , this could endanger a child care subsidy of $ 3,300 they receive per year as part of the union contract . The high stakes have challenged the unity of the strikers , as each student faces distinct and personal consequences should they lose their jobs . They will be taking a vote on Friday on how to proceed , and some appear ready to submit grades .\nThe strike \u201c has been a longtime coming , \u201d says Yulia Gilichinskaya , a student in the Film and Digital Media Department and co-president of the Graduate Student Association . She is part of a group of students that for the past year or so has been organizing around the cost-of-living crisis . A majority of student union members in Santa Cruz voted down the statewide contract signed by the UAW in summer 2018 because the annual three-percent wage increase can not keep up with their housing costs . After Measure M on rent control failed to pass in the 2018 midterm election , Gilichinskaya says , the students started to call for a campus-specific solution out of a feeling they had no other recourse . \u201c Everyone is so damn desperate . Some of us have been homeless and a lot of us are one paycheck away from homelessness . Housing in the Bay Area is pushing boundaries in terms of what is possible in organizing . \u201d\nIn Santa Cruz , downzoning is one of the main culprits , according to Steven McKay , associate professor of sociology and director of the UCSC Center for Labor Studies . Since the 1990s , county residents have voted for leadership that prioritizes single-family homes on large lots . Attempts to build more affordable , multi-family homes have been met with resistance by NIMBY organizations that push for zoning regulations and land-use policies to block new development . In Santa Cruz , many are averse to even four-story buildings . \u201c There \u2019 s a skyrocketing demand for housing , but no new housing , especially affordable housing , \u201d McKay says . This has only intensified in recent years , as Santa Cruz became a commuter town for Silicon Valley . And with a student body of over 18,000 , some of whom are squeezed into converted common dorm areas the university has been under pressure for a while to build more housing . A plan to build 3,000 new beds for graduate students has been frozen for over a year due to legal challenges from environmental groups .\nMcKay says the problem is much bigger than just Santa Cruz , and that if the university concedes , it would push the state to more fully fund the entire UC system , one of the largest employers in California . \u201c California is as flush as ever . It has a $ 20 billion surplus in its budget , \u201d he says . \u201c The strike is a real opportunity for UC to lead on a much bigger national issue : the funding of public higher education . The strike \u2019 s caught fire because it speaks to the real need for living wages and for truly affordable college for everyone . \u201d\nGraduate student instructors , readers and graders across the UC system earn $ 2,400 a month , for nine months\u2014around $ 21,000 a year\u2014as part of their union contract with the United Auto Workers Local 2865 , which represents more than 18,000 academic workers in the state . With average rents in Santa Cruz at $ 2,611 per month , many students live under extreme rent burden , paying 50\u201370 percent of their gross income on rent and utilities . According to a report released in October 2019 , over half of renter households ( nearly 21,300 of all 35,734 households ) in Santa Cruz County were considered rent burdened . ( Rent burden is defined as spending more than 30 percent of one \u2019 s income on rent . )\n\u201c We don \u2019 t know what our paycheck will look like this month . People are afraid they won \u2019 t get paid , \u201d says Kelsey James , a fourth-year psychology student on strike and a member of the union . \u201c But we also know this situation is untenable . If we didn \u2019 t do it now , people would soon be doing the same thing . It \u2019 s just unlivable . People are living in their cars . Everyone has a story about what they can \u2019 t afford. \u201d James says she pays $ 1,000 for a room in a house with two other roommates , spending nearly 60 percent of her income on housing .\nIn January , the university responded to the grade strike by proposing two measures for the next academic year : a $ 2,500 need-based housing fellowship ; and for doctoral students , a five-year funding program that guarantees part-time teaching assistant work . Students rejected the proposal , which they say would only decrease their rent burden by 5 percent .\nWhile students face a tough decision on whether and how to continue their strike , their efforts have already gotten widespread attention and galvanized a sense of solidarity . The union has called on the university to come to the bargaining table and reach a resolution . Members have raised over $ 85,000 dollars for a support fund . Students at UC Davis , UC San Diego , UC Berkeley and others have been emboldened to make their own calls for a COLA and held various sit-ins and marches this week . Both UCLA students and UC Santa Barbara students indicated a willingness to go on full strike if UCSC students are fired .\nUCSC faculty members have urged the university to halt disciplinary measures and instead open a direct line of communication . Some have joined students at the picket line . The Santa Cruz City Council voted unanimously to endorse the students \u2019 demands . The executive board of the Council of UC Faculty Associations , representing faculty on all 10 UC campuses , issued an open letter of support urging a resolution . Over 2,000 non-UCSC faculty across the country have signed a noncooperation pledge to boycott UCSC until it \u201c provides a more equitable standard of living. \u201d The West Virginia teachers who went on strike and successfully increased their wages in 2018 , sent a letter of support . City bus drivers in Santa Cruz have refused to cross the picket and drive into campus . And on Wednesday , Democratic frontrunner Bernie Sanders tweeted his support for the strikers .\nThis strike comes just weeks after Moms 4 Housing activists in Oakland secured a victory against a home-flipping business simply by occupying a vacant home . The acute burden of living in California has necessitated an acute response from Californians . \u201c Housing politics , \u201d McKay says , \u201c is the new class politics . \u201d\nMairav Zonszein is an Israeli-American journalist who covers resistance movements and all things dissent .

{"id":"5sNQZR245vJEu8kU","content":"National Democrats are casting about for ways to affirm their support for Israel while also signaling loyalty to President Obama and his bruised ego . Obama has presided over an unprecedented cold spell in US-Israeli relations , thanks to a toxic combination of his personal dislike of Benjamin Netanyahu ( evidently shared by many within his administration ) and his historically unfriendly posture toward our close ally . Some Senate Democrats sought to offer Netanyahu an opportunity to address their caucus in private , perhaps giving members cover to demonstrate pro-Obama solidarity by skipping the Prime Minister 's controversial address to a joint session of Congress next week . Netanyahu is n't playing along :\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declined on Tuesday an invitation to meet with U.S. Senate Democrats during his trip to Washington next week . `` Though I greatly appreciate your kind invitation to meet with Democratic Senators , I believe that doing so at this time could compound the misperception of partisanship regarding my upcoming visit , '' Netanyahu wrote in a letter to Senators Richard Durbin and Dianne Feinstein obtained by Reuters . Durbin and Feinstein , two senior Senate Democrats , invited Netanyahu to a closed-door meeting with Democratic senators in a letter on Monday , warning that making U.S.-Israeli relations a partisan political issue could have `` lasting repercussions '' ... In his letter , Netanyahu said he agreed `` wholeheartedly '' that strong ties between the United States and Israel have been built on bipartisan support .... He expressed appreciation for the opportunity to address lawmakers from both parties on Tuesday and said he regretted that the invitation has been perceived by some as partisan . `` I can assure you my sole intention in accepting it was to voice Israel 's grave concerns about a potential nuclear agreement with Iran that could threaten the survival of my country , '' Netanyahu wrote .\nAs a liberal Democrat who twice campaigned for President Barack Obama , I am appalled that some Democratic members of Congress are planning to boycott the speech of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on March 3 to a joint session of Congress . At bottom , this controversy is not mainly about protocol and politics\u2014it is about the constitutional system of checks and balances and the separation of powers . Under the Constitution , the executive and legislative branches share responsibility for making and implementing important foreign-policy decisions . Congress has a critical role to play in scrutinizing the decisions of the president when these decisions involve national security , relationships with allies and the threat of nuclear proliferation . Congress has every right to invite , even over the president \u2019 s strong objection , any world leader or international expert who can assist its members in formulating appropriate responses to the current deal being considered with Iran regarding its nuclear-weapons program . Indeed , it is the responsibility of every member of Congress to listen to Prime Minister Netanyahu , who probably knows more about this issue than any world leader , because it threatens the very existence of the nation state of the Jewish people . Congress has the right to disagree with the prime minister , but the idea that some members of Congress will not give him the courtesy of listening violates protocol and basic decency to a far greater extent than anything Mr. Netanyahu is accused of doing for having accepted an invitation from Congress .\nThe United States and Iran are shaping the contours of a deal that would initially freeze Tehran 's nuclear program but would allow it to slowly ramp up activities that could be used to make nuclear arms over the last years of the agreement 's duration ... The idea would be to reward Iran for good behavior over the last years of any agreement , by gradually lifting constraints on its uranium enrichment program imposed as part of a deal that would also would slowly ease sanctions on the Islamic Republic . Iran says it does not want nuclear arms and needs enrichment only for energy , medical and scientific purposes , but the U.S. fears Tehran could re-engineer the program to its other potential use - producing the fissile core of a nuclear weapon . The U.S. initially sought restrictions lasting for up to 20 years ; Iran had pushed for less than a decade . Iran could be allowed to operate significantly more centrifuges than the U.S. administration first demanded , though at lower capacity than they currently run . Several officials spoke of 6,500 centrifuges as a potential point of compromise . If the sides agree on 15 years , for instance , the strict controls could be in place for 10 years with gradual lifting over five . Possible easing of the controls could see Iran increasing the number of enriching centrifuges back toward the 10,000 or so it now has operating , and increasing the level of enrichment while keeping it well below levels approaching weapons-grade .\nWe 'll return to the rumored Iran deal in a moment , but first , Congressional Democrats must decide whether their loyalties lie with Obama 's partisan sensitivities , or America 's best friend in the Middle East . The White House has been fuming over the fact that House Speaker John Boehner broke protocol by extending an invitation to Netanyahu without notifying the president . At first , the spun a rumor that the Israeli leader had accepted prior to Obama even knowing about the invite , but that turned out to be false . The Obama administration has demonstrated little respect for the separation of powers , except when it serves their immediate political interests ; in those cases , they become real sticklers . One Democrat whose added his name to the boycott list is Senator ( and former DNC Chair ) Tim Kaine , who 's apparently following the anti-Israel lead of his fellow Virginia Democrats . Liberal law professor Alan Dershowitz , a strong Israel supporter , is aghast at his party 's conduct : Dershowitz notes that it 's really Obama who 's attacking the Constitution 's separation-of-powers framework , reasoning , `` what the president objects to is not that Mr. Netanyahu will speak to Congress , but the content of what he intends to say . This constitutes a direct intrusion on the power of Congress and on the constitutional separation of powers . '' True . Obama has long been obsessed with the legacy project of striking a `` groundbreaking '' and `` historic '' nuclear deal with regime in Tehran . Netanyahu fears that the bargain would endanger his people , and would foolishly assume the good intentions of Iran 's leaders . Obama does n't want that message forcefully delivered to Congress , which could complicate the politics surrounding his prized negotiations . The tentative outlines of a possible pact with Iran are starting to leak into the press : Charles Krauthammer calls this `` an unbelievably bad deal : '' In that same Special Report segment , Stephen Hayes recapped the reporting of his Weekly Standard colleague , who has revealed the Obama administration 's own assessment of a deadly arrangement between Iran and Al Qaeda . The US government regards Iran as the world 's chief exporter of terrorism , notorious for habitually cheating on international deals . It 's no wonder that even some liberal Democrats are gravely concerned about the White House 's interactions with the dangerous , genocidal regime -- whose negotiators are reputed to be abusive toward their Western counterparts . Netanyahu 's speech is scheduled for next Tuesday . Polls are mixed regarding the public 's stance on the circumstances surrounding his remarks , but Israel itself remains extraordinarily popular among the American people .","bias":2}

Trump to self-described democratic socialists like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ( D-NY ) and Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-VT ) .\nAt the 2019 annual meeting of the Conservative Political Action Conference , President Trump swore off socialism before a receptive crowd .\n`` Socialism is about only one thing : it 's called power for the ruling class , '' Trump said before concluding with a pledge he delivered at his State of the Union address weeks earlier : `` America will never be a socialist country . ''\nWhile polls show Americans overwhelmingly favor capitalism , they also reveal an increasing openness to socialist economic policies , particularly among Democrats and younger voters .\nWith the rise of interest in socialism , Arthur Brooks , president of the American Enterprise Institute , wants people to take a fresh look at its counterpart .\n`` Democratic capitalism has pulled billions of people out of poverty . It is the greatest humanitarian achievement in the history of mankind , '' Brooks told \u2588\u2588\u2588 News .\nBrooks teamed up with Emergent Order to produce a documentary called `` The Pursuit . '' It features him traveling across the globe \u2013 to Europe , to Kentucky coal country , and the remote Indian foothills of Dharamsala to meet with the Dalai Lama .\nThe film highlights the benefits of capitalism by focusing on Brooks ' lifelong passion : finding ways to lift people out of poverty . His quest also takes viewers on a journey exploring different ideas that lead to true happiness .\n`` We 're in this culture war about capitalism : should we have socialism or capitalism ? And that 's the wrong argument . That 's the wrong discussion , '' Brooks explained . `` We should be talking about am I my brother 's keeper or am I not my brother 's keeper ? And if I am what 's the best way to do it ? That 's what this film is about . ''\nBrooks , 54 , said during his lifetime , the world has witnessed an 80 percent decline in poverty . He credits that decline to capitalism , calling it a miraculous tool for good when based on morality rather than greed .\n`` The point of capitalism is not for me and you to get richer . It 's to share the abundance and earned success - the equal dignity of life with other people , '' he told \u2588\u2588\u2588 News .\n`` Here 's the great irony of our times : People in the wealthiest countries in the world are increasingly turning against the very system that 's lifted us out of poverty , '' Brooks said in the film 's trailer .\nHe pointed out that people in democratic socialist economies like Denmark appear to be happy . However , he said he discovered what separates Americans is a sense of joy that comes from our self-made will to flourish .\n`` I 'm not trashing Denmark . I think Denmark is great . I think a lot of people are very happy in Denmark , '' he continued . `` But I 'm really truly joyful that I 'm an American .\n`` The thing that I really learned going to talk about these democratic socialist countries is that I want to live in a country of ambitious riffraff , because that 's what I am and that 's what we all are , '' he told \u2588\u2588\u2588 News . `` We 're trying to build something from nothing . That 's not the ethos in most countries around the world . ''\nBrooks believes the film plunges much deeper than simply comparing economic theories and systems . It imagines the possibilities of a better world by exploring the themes of opportunity , prosperity , compassion , and human dignity for everyone .\n`` The Pursuit '' released in theaters April 29th and will be available digitally on iTunes on May 7th .","bias":2}
{"id":"DOqwvvdmd3rPHvJT","content":"New York ( CNN ) -- You could be forgiven for thinking no one cares -- or even should care , right now -- about climate change .\nFor starters , there 's all that other terrifying stuff competing for attention : President Barack Obama 's war with ISIS ; the Ebola outbreak , which recently put Sierra Leone on national lockdown ; Ukraine ; Scotland ; wife-beating athletes . That scary guy in Pennsylvania .\nThe world seems like a pretty big mess right now .\nPolls indicate Americans care less about climate change than pretty much anything . Even among those of us who are inclined to care about the planet , there 's the holy-crap-I-can't-even-deal-with-it factor . It seems too big , too daunting -- and like so much damage is already being done .\nBut I put those doubts completely to rest on Sunday as I wove through hopeful crowds of thousands at the People 's Climate March in New York , which was billed by organizers as the biggest rally against climate change world has ever seen . There was no independent estimate of the size of the crowd immediately available , but organizers said as many as 310,000 people attended -- many from far reaches of the globe , ahead of a UN climate summit here this week .\nWorld leaders are expected to discuss the topic and , hopefully , build momentum for more-concrete climate talks in Paris next year . Climate marches also were held on Sunday in 2,800 other locations , according to organizers , from Paris to Port Moresby , Papua New Guinea .\nIn a world disinclined to care about the urgent threat of climate change , these were the people who are both experiencing the crisis -- right now , not 100 years in the future -- and who also believe there 's still time to make a difference .\n`` I am fearful , but for the most part , I 'm optimistic , '' said Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner , a 26-year-old who came to New York from the Marshall Islands , in the Pacific . Sea level rise already is washing away grave sites and lashing homes on the islands , she said . She came to New York in part to represent her 7-month-old daughter , who she hopes will be able to live on the island , rather than relocate . `` I see this movement and I see this march and I see all these thousands of people coming together for climate change ; I believe there are things we can do to change the world .\nIt 's not possible for her to ignore this issue like the rest of us .\n`` The thing you have to imagine is the ocean is huge next to our islands , '' she told me . `` Our islands are completely tiny ... You do n't get to forget how vulnerable you are . ''\nThe march , which wandered along the edge of Central Park and through the streets of Midtown Manhattan , took on the feel of a celebration for a planet that 's worth saving rather than a funeral for one already lost .\nI saw accordions , drums , a giant-dancing-puppet representation of Mother Earth . The mood was a bit surprising considering some climate scientists and policy experts say the world already has acted far too slowly to curb carbon emissions and that we 're locked into some level of harmful warming . The atmosphere already has warmed about 1-degree Celsius because of people , said Bill McKibben , co-founder of 350.org , which helped organize the events . `` That 's enormous , '' he told me . `` It 's been enough already to melt the summer Arctic '' and to increase ocean acidification by 30 % . `` As astonishing as those changes are , they are a very small trailer for the horror movie that 's coming if we do n't act quickly , '' he said .\nAnd that 's what people here were calling for : Quick , assured action . A reduction in harmful carbon emissions . Real targets , based on science . New , clean industry . A revolution , really -- an economy that looks beyond the fossil era . I met people from China , Tibet , West Virginia , Arizona -- all of whom want the world to act .\n`` We are here representing the Earth , '' said Whatwen\u00efne `` Freida '' Jacques , 64 , who moving with the crowd in a motorized wheelchair . `` I really think this should have happened a good 20 years ago .

''\n`` We are at the front lines of climate change , '' she said , echoing a familiar refrain . `` Our communities are going to be the first climate change refugees of our country ... As we lose the land , we 're also going to be losing cultures . ''\nSome of the most poignant pleas for action came from people impacted by Superstorm Sandy , which hit New York in October 2012 , filling subways with water , displacing coastal residents and killing more than 100 people in the United States as well as more than 60 in the Caribbean and Canada . Hurricanes are expected to continue to get stronger as the climate warms , and locals here fear a repeat tragedy .\nI met Silaka Cox , 19 , from the Rockaways , at the city 's edge . It was hit hard by Sandy . If climate change is n't stopped , Cox told me she worries her community , where she still lives even though it means a 1 1\/2 hour commute to New York University , where she 's a sophomore , might not be viable . `` The sea levels are just going to keep rising if we do n't do anything about it , '' she said .\nAnd I met Brendan McAvoy , a 21-year old who lost his home in the storm . He came to the rally Sunday with a blue sign simply reading , `` Hope . '' The letters were made of sand he collected from the beach in New Jersey . He told me he initially made the sign for his mom , to help get her through the months after the storm .\n`` That 's all you have when the water takes away your house and takes away your family , '' he said , referencing the fact that he attributes his father 's death , after the storm , in part to the stress caused by the displacement . `` All you have is hope . ''\nClimate change is a collective tinnitus -- always ringing in the background , but so constant and seemingly incurable that we try to ignore it .\nThat 's impossible for McAvoy and the others I met on Sunday . For them , climate change is sounding an alarm far too loud to be silenced .\nTo demonstrate this in the most literal of ways , rally attendees raised their hands in the air in a moment of silence at 12:58 p.m. Then at 1 p.m. , they let out a collective yelp .\nIt was so loud and heartfelt it gave me chills .\nI hope it brought some degree of comfort -- and maybe inspiration -- to all those attending whose lives already are being shaken up by this crisis , which the world should act far more urgently to address . As I heard from many people I met , we have the technology and the popular will to fix this . It 's just time for someone in power to listen .","bias":0}
{"id":"2NnkqjwL95lv2dOS","content":"Washington ( CNN ) The request by House Democrats for six years of Donald Trump 's tax returns opens a serious new political , legal , constitutional and personal front in the party 's battle to use its new majority to check a defiant President .\nIt is a bid to solve one of the most tantalizing and enduring mysteries of Trump 's 2016 campaign and his presidency -- what is it in the President 's unseen financial and business life that he does n't want Americans to see ?\nThe historic move , made official by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal on Wednesday , is all but certain to unleash a legal battle narrowing in on Trump 's most guarded secrets that could drag on for months or even years while shaping the terrain of the 2020 election .\nThe confrontation , will in its broadest sense , establish the extent to which Congress has the power to examine the executive and enforce a long-observed norm -- that party nominees and Presidents release their returns to the public .\nBut Democrats say this is not a matter of choice , it 's the law , as they yet again seek to straddle the fine line between legitimate oversight and the risk of being seen as overreaching in a way that could rebound against them politically .\nThe request represents a remarkable moment and another monument to the unconventional nature of the Trump era , since no Congress has attempted such a challenge before -- simply because no President in recent times has resisted such a basic test of transparency .\nNeal , the only Democrat on Capitol Hill with the power to take such action , is using a little-known IRS code in requesting six years of Trump 's personal returns and also wants records from eight of the President 's business entities . His request is narrowly targeted and rooted in a legal technicality .\nBut supporters of the drive to get clarity on Trump 's taxes argue that it is vital for Congress to establish whether Trump has any conflicts of interest that bear on his official duties and to see whether he is getting payments from foreign states in violation of the emoluments clause of the Constitution .\nDemocrats have also justified an effort to open Trump 's returns as a way to examine how much he and his businesses -- from which he is not fully divested -- benefited from the massive GOP tax reform law .\nTrump has also been accused , notably by his former attorney Michael Cohen , of both deflating and over estimating the value of his properties and assets in insurance claims and on loan applications \u2014 a practice on which tax returns could shed light .\nNeal , who was facing increasing pressure from liberal activists to speed up a meticulous process of requesting the returns , insisted his move was about `` policy not politics , '' in a letter to the IRS .\n`` I am certain we are within our legitimate legislative , legal and oversight rights , '' said Neal , a 16-term congressman who is not well known outside his home state of Massachusetts or the halls of power on Capitol Hill , said in a statement .\nNeal , 70 , will now shed his relative obscurity and become one of the top political generals in the Democratic battle against Trump -- and will have to accept all the vitriol , attacks and mockery that comes with taking on the President .\nThough he insisted his move was not political , it will inevitably be seen in the context of a widening use of Democratic muscle following the party 's capture of the House in November .\nJust this week , House committee chairs have readied subpoenas to demand the full release of Robert Mueller 's Russia report and to examine accusations of abuses in the White House 's handling of top secret security clearances .\nNeal 's intervention came less than two weeks after Mueller ended his investigation and a summary by Attorney General William Barr said the special counsel did not establish there was cooperation between Trump 's team and Russia 's election meddling scheme or decide whether the President obstructed justice .\nThe request dampened the hopes of liberals in the party 's grass roots that an impeachment saga could be looming . The New York Times , however , reported on Wednesday evening that some of Mueller 's investigators have told associates that the findings of the original report are more damaging for the President than Barr indicated .\nTrump shrugged off the Democratic request for his taxes on Wednesday evening , using similar phraseology as when he was asked during the campaign about his taxes .\nAsked whether he would comply with the Democratic request , Trump said that `` until such time as I 'm not under audit I would not be inclined to do that . ''\nJUST WATCHED These are Trump 's Fox News hires ( 2018 ) Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH These are Trump 's Fox News hires ( 2018 ) 01:24\nRepublicans are certain to argue that the request for Trump 's taxes is yet another example of unreasonable scrutiny by Democrats frustrated with indications that Mueller 's report will not doom Trump 's presidency . One reason that the request appears to be comparatively narrow -- for returns between 2013 and 2018 -- could be to confine the search to the period immediately before and during Trump 's political career and to stave off accusations that the Democrats are embarking on an illegitimate fishing expedition .\nThe drama threatens to draw in some key members of the Trump administration -- including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin .\nMnuchin said at a congressional hearing in March that he would `` comply with the law '' if asked to release Trump 's returns -- though also suggested the final call could rest with the commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service .\nIt is significant therefore that Neal 's request was made to the IRS and not the Treasury .\nIt is certain that the President would see any decision by Mnuchin to get involved and comply with Neal 's request as a flagrant personal betrayal .\nNeal 's gambit now puts Charles Rettig , the current IRS commissioner , who was nominated by Trump and confirmed by the Senate , in a delicate political position .\nIt is all but certain that the administration will take steps to challenge the Democratic interpretation of the law on which the request is based . Such a scenario could see the Ways and Means committee issue a subpoena after Neal 's April 10 deadline and the unleashing of a complicated legal duel .\nThe fight could become a cause celebre that works its way through the court system and even reaches the Supreme Court , and the conservative majority that is newly restocked by Trump .\nThe committee spent weeks plotting its move in the hope of preparing the most complete case possible for the court battle to come .\nNeal argued that he needed to see Trump 's returns in order to properly consider legislation related to the IRS 's practice of auditing sitting presidents .\n`` Under the Internal Revenue Manual , individual income tax returns of a President are subject to mandatory examination , but this practice is IRS policy and not codified in the Federal tax laws , '' Neal wrote in a letter to the IRS .\n`` It is necessary for the committee to determine the scope of any such examination and whether it includes a review of underlying business activities required to be reported on the individual income tax return . ''\nTrump has long seen scrutiny of his complicated and difficult to penetrate personal finances as a red line that should not be crossed .\nIn addition to Trump 's personal records , Neal requested information from the President 's business entities , including the Bedminster golf course LLC , as well as DJT Holdings LLC , DJT Holdings Managing Member LLC , DTTM Operations LLC , DTTM Operations Managing Member Cor , LFB Acquisition Member Corp and LFB Acquisition LLC .\nNeal 's request is specific and under the section of the IRS code that he is using only he , and not other chairmen of House committees can see the returns .\nIt would require a vote in the committee to release any such documents to the public if they are eventually handed over .","bias":0}

{"id":"81rFfToHAO6383dW","content":"( CNN ) How do all seven cars and the engine of an Amtrak train jump the rails , sending passengers , luggage , laptops and more flying ?\nAuthorities have n't said what caused the derailment of Amtrak Northeast Regional Train 188 in Philadelphia on Tuesday night , but Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter had harsh words for the train 's engineer .\n`` Clearly it was reckless in terms of the driving by the engineer . There 's no way in the world he should have been going that fast into the curve , '' Nutter told CNN 's `` The Situation Room . ''\nPreliminary data show the train 's speed exceeded 100 mph before the derailment . That would be more than twice the 50 mph speed limit for the curve it was in .\n`` I do n't know what was going on with him ( the engineer ) . I do n't know what was going on in the cab , but there 's really no excuse that can be offered , literally , unless he had a heart attack , '' Nutter said .\nNTSB board member Robert Sumwalt immediately slammed the mayor 's comments as inflammatory .\n`` You 're not going to hear the NTSB making comments like that . We want to get the facts before we start making judgments , '' Sumwalt said .\nThe engineer at the helm of Amtrak Train 188 on Tuesday night , May 13 , 2015 , was identified to CNN as Brandon Bostian , 32 , of New York .\nThe engineer operating the train , identified to CNN as 32-year-old Brandon Bostian from New York , applied full emergency brakes `` just moments '' before the train derailed , according to Sumwalt . The train was traveling about 106 mph as it headed into a left turn . The speed limit immediately before the curve was 80 mph .\nAn official with direct knowledge of the investigation earlier said that authorities were focusing on speed as a possible cause , given the angles of the wreckage and type of damage to the cars . The recorder , or `` black box , '' discovered at the scene could be pivotal by showing just that , former NTSB official John Goglia said .\nPeter Goelz , once a top NTSB figure and now a CNN analyst , predicted that a definitive conclusion could come soon .\n`` I 'm afraid that this train might be going too fast for this turn , '' he said .\nSumwalt has said only that his team will examine things such as the condition of the track and the train , how the signals operated and `` human performance . ''\nEven if it 's determined the train was going too fast , that could be because of the engineer or a mechanical issue , such as faulty brakes .\n`` You have a lot of questions , we have a lot of questions , '' Sumwalt told reporters . `` We intend to answer many of those questions in the next 24 to 48 hours . ''\nSome 238 passengers and five crew members were on the train when it crashed around 9:30 p.m. Tuesday . Authorities said that at least seven people were killed .\nOne of those who died was Jim Gaines , a father of two who worked as a video software architect for The Associated Press , his company said\nHis family asked for privacy , saying : `` Jim was more precious to us than we can adequately express . ''\nAnother was a U.S . Naval Academy midshipman in full uniform heading home to New York on leave from the Annapolis , Maryland , school . A family member described 20-year-old Justin Zemser as a great person and genius whose death has left his parents `` beside themselves . ''\nDerrick Griffith , dean of student affairs for City University of New York Medgar Evers College , was also among the fatalities , according to Jamilah Fraser , a spokeswoman for the university . He lived in Brooklyn .\nHospitals have treated more than 200 others , many of whom have been released . That figure included eight in critical condition at Temple University Hospital -- the closest trauma center to the crash site -- according to Herb Cushing , the hospital 's medical director .\nCushing said many passengers were injured when other passengers or objects fell on them . One of those hurt is the train 's engineer , who received medical treatment and was interviewed by police , Mayor Nutter said .\nBostian , the engineer , initially told Philadelphia police he could not recall his speed , according to a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation .\nDetectives have since tried to interview the engineer of the train further . They brought him in Wednesday , but he refused to be interviewed , and left with a lawyer , according to a police official .\nPolice are in the process of getting a search warrant for the engineer 's phone records so they can determine whether he was distracted at the time of the crash , the law enforcement official said .\nDetermining Bostian 's blood-alcohol level immediately after the crash would be a normal part of the investigation , according to Sumwalt . Regulations require Amtrak to take a blood sample .\n`` It should have been done , and I have no reason to believe it was not done , '' Sumwalt said .\nAccording to Bostian 's LinkedIn profile , he has been an engineer for Amtrak since 2010 , and was a conductor for four years before that . Prior to Amtrak , Bostian worked as a cashier at Target .\nCNN spoke to a neighbor of the engineer near his home in Forest Hills , New York , who last saw him two weeks ago . Moresh Koya described Bostian as responsible and happy with his job .\nAuthorities have not ruled out the possibility of more victims at the crash site . Nutter noted that not everyone on Amtrak 's manifest has been accounted for . He did n't specify a number .\n`` We are heartbroken by what we 've experienced here , '' the mayor said early Wednesday . `` We have not experienced anything like this in modern times . ''\nThe miracle may be how some escaped relatively unscathed , given the severity of the derailment . A U.S. Department of Transportation representative told CNN that the engine and two cars were left standing upright , three cars were tipped on their sides , and one was nearly flipped over on its roof . The seventh one was `` leaning hard . ''\n`` It is amazing , '' Nutter said . `` I saw some people last night literally walking off that train . I do n't know how they did it .

{"id":"ooh6p0YxwM4Dfa0B","content":"On Monday , the Senate will hold a procedural vote on a bill that would make abortion after 20 weeks illegal in every state in the country . Called the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act , it \u2019 s based on the idea that a fetus at 20 weeks \u2019 gestation can feel pain .\n\u201c The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act will protect the voiceless , the vulnerable , and the marginalized , '' said Rep. Kevin McCarthy ( R-CA ) , the House majority leader , in a statement in September ( the House passed the bill in early October ) . `` It will protect those children who science has proven can feel pain. \u201d While the bill is unlikely to pass the Senate because of the 60 votes required , President Donald Trump has promised to sign the it if it passes ; during the campaign , he said such a bill \u201c would end painful late-term abortions nationwide . \u201d\nIn fact , the best available science shows that fetuses probably can not feel pain until well after 20 weeks . Advocates of abortion rights say 20-week bans at the state level have harmed women , forcing them to travel to another state , often at great expense , to get the care they seek . And opponents of the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act fear that , even if it never passes , it will ultimately spread dangerous misinformation .\nThe Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act is not based on accepted science\nThe bill , sponsored by Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R-SC ) , would ban abortions after 20 weeks nationwide , except in cases of rape , incest , or a threat to the life of the mother . A doctor who performed an abortion after 20 weeks , except in those cases , could face up to five years in prison . Women seeking abortions would not be penalized under the bill .\nThe text of the bill includes a section on the science of fetal pain , which states that \u201c there is substantial medical evidence that an unborn child is capable of experiencing pain at least by 20 weeks after fertilization , if not earlier . \u201d\nHowever , the general scientific consensus is that no such evidence exists . \u201c There \u2019 s actually conclusive evidence that shows that the neurologic structures in a fetus aren \u2019 t completely laid down and working yet until much further along in pregnancy , we think even the third trimester , \u201d said Jennifer Conti , a clinical assistant professor and OB-GYN at Stanford University and a fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health . Twenty weeks , she said , \u201c is just an arbitrary limit set in place by politicians that has no medical or scientific backing . \u201d\nThe most comprehensive look at fetal pain to date was a literature review published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2005 . According to the review , the structures needed for fetuses to feel pain begin to develop between 23 and 30 weeks \u2019 gestation , and studies of premature babies suggest they can \u2019 t feel pain until 29 or 30 weeks . While this review is now 12 years old , it still holds true \u2014 \u201c no research since its publication has contradicted its findings , \u201d wrote Mark S. DeFrancesco on behalf of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in 2015 .\nThe bill makes a number of claims that contradict scientific consensus . For instance , the bill states that \u201c after 20 weeks , the unborn child reacts to stimuli that would be recognized as painful if applied to an adult human , for example , by recoiling. \u201d However , according to the group Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health ( ANSIRH ) at the University of California , San Francisco , \u201c limb withdrawal occurs even in full-term babies in response to non-painful tactile sensations , including light touch . Thus the appearance of limb withdrawal on ultrasound represents a reflex rather than a response to pain . \u201d\nThe bill , said Amy Friedrich-Karnik , senior federal policy adviser at the Center for Reproductive Rights , is \u201c basically relying on junk science . \u201d\nThis bill isn \u2019 t new \u2014 and we \u2019 ve already seen some of its effects\nThe Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act previously passed the House in 2015 , as Jessie Hellmann notes at the Hill , but failed in the Senate . Similar bans have also passed in more than a dozen states .\nPeople seek abortions after 20 weeks for a variety of reasons . One patient who came to Conti seeking an abortion said that a clinic the previous week had told her she was 12 weeks pregnant . But the clinic turned out to be a crisis pregnancy center that had given her incorrect information \u2014 she was actually 21 weeks along . \u201c Essentially her care was sabotaged , \u201d Conti said \u2014 and under a 20-week ban , she would have been unable to get an abortion .\nPatients can also be pushed to get abortions later in pregnancy by financial or logistical problems , like difficulty getting to a clinic or getting together the money for the procedure . In states with 20-week bans already in place , patients who need later abortions typically have to travel to another state , said Friedrich-Karnik . That can cause enormous financial strain , she said . But \u201c to imagine a ban like this nationwide and to think that no one could even have the opportunity to go to another state to get the care is frightening . \u201d\nThe bill passed the House by a vote of 237-189 . It probably will not pass the Senate , Hellmann writes , where it would need a 60-vote majority . Republicans may be using Monday \u2019 s vote as a way to put pressure on Democratic senators in red states , like Claire McCaskill ( D-MO ) and Heidi Heitkamp ( D-ND ) , Hellmann noted in January . Both voted against the 20-week ban in 2015 , and anti-abortion activists hope a vote against the bill this year will make the senators vulnerable in November \u2019 s elections .\nEven if it never becomes federal law , Conti said , the bill can still cause harm . \u201c By even putting this issue on a national platform , \u201d she said , \u201c you \u2019 re misleading the American people . \u201d\n\u201c You \u2019 re really providing false and dangerous information that is affecting millions of women , \u201d she added .","bias":0}
{"id":"ChAFLpgaRAoIXj3X","content":"A move to shift power away from the New York Federal Reserve Bank is finding some powerful friends in Congress amid lingering worries that a key part of the central bank is too cozy with Wall Street .\nTwo Republicans running the banking committees have both said they plan to explore proposals from the outspoken , former Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher that would roll back a long-standing provision that gives the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank an automatic position as vice chairman of a powerful committee and weaken New York \u2019 s oversight of Wall Street banks .\nThe politics may be ripe for chipping away at the power of the Federal Reserve , uniting liberals who want to crack down on Wall Street , Republicans who don \u2019 t like the Fed \u2019 s easy money policies and libertarians who are suspicious of the Fed altogether .\nThe move also reflects some regional rivalries within the Fed \u2014 the New York Federal Reserve Bank often overshadows other regional banks , and Fisher , known as a rabble rouser in Federal Reserve politics , has been lobbying for a change to the power structure .\nBanking Chairman Richard Shelby ( R-Ala. ) and House Financial Services Jeb Hensarling ( R-Texas ) say they \u2019 re open to reducing the power of the New York Fed , and the move has the potential to appeal to Democrats who have been critical of the Fed , like Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D-Mass ) .\n\u201c Mr . Fisher \u2019 s proposal dealing with the Fed and the Federal Open Market Committee \u2014 we \u2019 re going to pursue all that and that would include the role of the New York Fed , \u201d Shelby said last week .\nAnd some Democrats have also said they \u2019 re open to policies that shift power away from the New York Fed .\n\u201c The New York Fed plays an extraordinary role , and maybe it \u2019 s extraordinarily captured , but it also represents only 6 percent of the population , \u201d said Rep. Brad Sherman , ( D-Calif. ) who wants to give a permanent vote on monetary policy decisions to the San Francisco Fed , which serves nine western states and 20 percent of the population .\nSen. Mark Warner ( D-Va. ) , a moderate who said he hasn \u2019 t taken a position on the proposals yet , said , \u201c I do think there \u2019 s been some legitimate questions of the role of the New York Fed . \u201d\nFisher , who retired Thursday after 10 years at the Dallas Fed , wants to yank the New York Fed \u2019 s permanent position as vice chair of the all-powerful Federal Open Market Committee , the panel charged with making monetary policy decisions , which met Wednesday .\nWhile the New York Fed president could still participate in monetary policy discussions , he or she would no longer always get a vote . Fisher suggested the job should rotate among the regional Federal Reserve Banks every two years .\nThe move would upend the current structure , as the New York Fed has had a lock on that spot since 1936 , thanks largely to its role as the infrastructure , which supplies the trading desk that carries out the Fed \u2019 s monetary policy decisions .\nFisher is also proposing that other regional Fed banks oversee some of the Wall Street giants in a move aimed at addressing criticism the New York Fed missed warning signs of the financial crisis , is too soft on Wall Street and holds too much power and influence at the Fed .\n\u201c The greatest concern appears to be the problem of regulatory capture by the largest and most powerful institutions , \u201d Fisher said in a February speech in New York laying out his plan .\nWall Street critics have been suspicious of the New York Fed since it and its then leader , Timothy Geithner , played a key role in responding to the 2008 financial crisis and the bailouts that entailed .\nLate last year its current president , William Dudley , was hauled before the Senate Banking Committee after reports from ProPublica and NPR \u2019 s This American Life that focused on a New York Fed examiner who said her warnings about certain business practices and deals at Goldman Sachs were ignored or brushed aside by her superiors . She provided recordings of her dealings with Fed officials to back up her case .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve got on tape higher-ups at the New York Fed calling off the regulators , \u201d Warren told Dudley at the November hearing . \u201c And I \u2019 m just asking the same kind of question \u2014 is there a cultural problem at the New York Fed ? I think the evidence suggests that there is . \u201d\nFormer Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher . | AP photo\nThe two most powerful lawmakers on financial policy say they are closely looking at Fisher \u2019 s proposal .\n\u201c I \u2019 m going to take a very serious look at that proposal , \u201d said Hensarling . Hensarling said his panel will soon be working on another package of changes to reshape the Federal Reserve and \u201c ensure we have a predictable rules-based monetary policy that works for working Americans . But anything that Richard Fisher proposes is going to get a very serious review from our committee . \u201d\nSimilarly , Shelby told reporters last week he plans to pursue the proposal .\n\u201c This is 2015 and things have changed , \u201d said Shelby , who is quietly working on a Senate legislative package . \u201c We have a shift in population . Everything used to be in New York and a lot of it \u2019 s not . \u201d\nPart of the idea \u2019 s popularity may also be that it \u2019 s coming from Fisher , who is a strange political animal .\nHe ran for U.S. Senate as a conservative Democrat back in 1993 \u2014 which he now calls his \u201c midlife crisis \u201d moment , losing to former Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison ( R-Texas ) . He worked in the Carter and Clinton Administrations and later worked for Henry Kissinger \u2019 s consulting firm , before joining the Dallas Fed . He also spent much of the 1990s running his own investment firm .\nSome Republicans like Fisher , because he often bucked the majority on the Fed , opposing the continued expansion of economic stimulus measures , which he called \u201c monetary Ritalin \u201d for the markets . Fisher is considered a \u201c hawk , \u201d a monetary conservative who worries most about inflation , which jives with the thinking of Republicans and their policies .\n\u201c I have the highest regard for Richard Fisher , he \u2019 ll certainly be missed , his voice on monetary policy , \u201d said Hensarling , who represents part of Dallas , although not Fisher .\nFisher is also known for being one of the louder voices calling for regulators to chop up the giant megabanks into smaller banks . And two years ago , he took an unprecedented step for a Fed president of attending the an annual gathering of conservatives , Conservative Political Action Conference , to make the case for breaking up Wall Street giants .\nThe big question now is whether his proposals can make it into legislative text .\nWhile Shelby likes the idea , other senators on his committee , including Republican Bob Corker and Democrats Jack Reed and Heidi Heitkamp said they \u2019 re not ready to weigh in . For his part , Reed has a different bill to require the president of the New York Fed to be presidentially appointed and confirmed by Congress rather than selected by its board .\nHowever , the ranking Democrat on the panel , Sen. Sherrod Brown , is cool to the proposal and said he doesn \u2019 t think Fisher \u2019 s proposal \u201c changes much. \u201d And Sen. Bob . Menendez ( D-N.J. ) said he has concerns about shifting power away from the New York Fed .\n\u201c I think the New York Fed plays an important role in the Fed system . And I don \u2019 t take lightly to some of the changes being discussed , \u201d Menendez said . \u201c Some of what I \u2019 ve seen is too far reaching . \u201d\nWhen \u2588\u2588\u2588 asked about the proposal in a press conference recently , Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said she thinks the current system \u201c works well , \u201d and that there were good reasons for the current structure giving New York a permanent spot on the FOMC . But she added it was up to Congress .\nThe Dallas Federal Reserve said Fisher was unavailable to comment in his last week on the job , but a spokesman confirmed Fisher has been fielding questions from lawmakers on the hill on his proposal .\nAnd Fisher is reportedly thrilled that there \u2019 s interest in this idea , said Camden Fine , president and CEO of the Independent Community Bankers of America , which is also pushing for Fisher \u2019 s proposal . Fine said he spoke with Fisher just last week about the idea , which \u201c would balance the Federal Reserve , \u201d and reflect that \u201c economic centers are no longer concentrated on Manhattan island , \u201d Fine said .\nFisher also assured Fine that his retirement from the Dallas Fed won \u2019 t dampen his enthusiastic voice for pushing his proposals . \u201c He \u2019 s not going anywhere , \u201d Fine said .","bias":0}

{"id":"mtHOiyYhhJQE6m0h","content":"Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions is accusing the Obama administration of failing to enforce a century-old law meant to prevent immigrants from taking root in the U.S. only to live on the government dole -- after the administration reported it did not cite anyone for this last year .\n`` Virtually no one one is being examined before they enter the country on whether or not they 'll ... immediately begin to depend on government welfare , '' Sessions , R-Ala. , top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nAs Congress weighs new immigration legislation , Sessions said any reform package `` has got to end that . ''\nSessions turned up new statistics from the Department of Homeland Security last week showing what he describes as a startling trend . DHS reported how relatively few immigrants are being turned away on the grounds that they are likely to become a `` public charge '' -- or individuals who depend on welfare programs -- despite a 100-year-old law that 's supposed to prevent this .\nThe department , blaming `` data entry quality , '' said it did not have complete information on how many immigrants became public charges . But the department did a case-by-case review for the bulk of fiscal 2012 , and found just one where that claim was leveled at an immigrant . `` However , the charge was later withdrawn , '' DHS reported .\nFurther , the department reported that just a tiny fraction of people are rejected on these grounds when seeking entry under a program that allows admission for 90 days for travelers from certain countries . Between fiscal 2005 and most of fiscal 2012 , a total of 9,796 were denied -- a fraction of a percent of those admitted . State Department figures for visa applications showed a similar trend , with just .068 percent of visa applications denied on those grounds in fiscal 2011 .\nSessions has been hammering this issue for months . He and other Republican senators earlier wrote to the departments of Homeland Security and State arguing that a bedrock principle of immigration law is that `` those who seek citizenship in this country ought to be financially self-sufficient . ''\nThe senator suggests the immigration system has produced a lopsided result in which high-skill immigrants are turned away while those who end up absorbing more taxpayer dollars than they contribute stay .\nRecent studies show welfare spending on immigrant-headed households is relatively high . A Center for Immigration Studies report found that 36 percent of these households were using `` at least one major welfare program '' in 2010 -- compared with 23 percent of other households .\nSessions ' office says the number of non-citizens on food stamps has skyrocketed in recent years . And the conservative Heritage Foundation claims low-skill immigrant households take in roughly $ 20,000 more in government benefits every year than they pay in taxes .\nSessions suggests the government is fueling this trend . He earlier made a stink over long-running U.S. Department of Agriculture radio `` novelas '' that depicted people being pressured into going on food stamps . The ads were later discontinued . The senator also is drawing attention to the WelcomeToUSA.gov site that provides information on a host of taxpayer assistance programs for immigrants , including Medicare , food stamps , Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and others .","bias":2}

He 's also trying to pressure Texas Gov . Rick Perry to expand Medicaid . `` You 've all heard about the website woes , '' Obama told about 150 people at Temple Emanu-El in Dallas . `` Nothing drives me more crazy than the fact that right now , there is great insurance to be had out there , choice and competition , where people can save money for a better product , except too many folks have not been able to get through the website . `` Now , this is like having a really good product in the store and the cash registers do n't work and there are n't enough parking spots and nobody can get through the door . `` So we are working overtime to get this fixed , '' the president said . `` And the website is already better than it was at the beginning of October .

But millions of Americans are now discovering that simply is n't true . `` Now he 's coming to Texas in a desperate attempt to salvage his ill-conceived and unpopular program from a Titanic fate by preaching expansion of the same Medicaid system he himself admits is broken . `` In Texas , where Medicaid already consumes a quarter of the state budget , we simply need the flexibility to implement fundamental , state-specific reforms to our Medicaid program , instead of a one-size-fits-all Washington mandate before it bankrupts our state. '' Mr . President , Texans are n't the reason Obamacare is crumbling , '' Perry said . `` Obamacare is the reason Obamacare is crumbling . `` The White House has pointed out Dallas is among the top 10 cities for uninsured Americans , according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram Obama , who was also in Texas for two high-priced fundraisers , added , `` This is a no-brainer .

{"id":"z8axa3Nh6QoWYv1G","content":"The United States found itself involved in a lengthy , divisive , military conflict overseas .\nA surfeit of controversial incidents besieged the U.S. military and confounded official Washington as to what to do . Leaders at the National Security Council argued that local fighters were improving their military skills . As a result , the U.S. could cede more power to them .\nIn other words , the war needed to be \u201c de-Americanized. \u201d Instead , the Defense secretary chose another term : \u201c Vietnamization . \u201d\nThe above scenario obviously isn \u2019 t about the four U.S. soldiers killed earlier this month in Niger . It isn \u2019 t about President Trump \u2019 s decision in August to maintain the U.S. mission in Afghanistan and bolster troop levels there .\nBut what the U.S. is doing in Niger and Chad and Mali and Afghanistan and Iraq and Libya and Djibouti and Turkey and Yemen and Jordan and Uganda and Cameroon and South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic and Somalia and Kosovo and Cuba and parts of Syria \u2026certainly echoes Defense Secretary Melvin Laird telling President Richard Nixon the U.S. should \u201c Vietnamize \u201d the battle in southeast Asia .\nThat would denote a shift . Laird asserted that \u201c Vietnamization \u201d properly characterized U.S. involvement going forward . After all , the U.S. didn \u2019 t want an open-ended commitment in Vietnam . Many in Washington wanted to get out as soon as possible .\nThings certainly didn \u2019 t work out that way . The U.S. found itself paralyzed in Vietnam for years . As a result , \u201c Vietnam Syndrome \u201d set in among the public and the nation \u2019 s political leaders . Americans were reluctant to engage overseas .\nIn a speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars , President Ronald Reagan said that the U.S. lived with Vietnam Syndrome for \u201c too long. \u201d As a result , Reagan said Americans \u201c were told that peace would come if we would simply stop interfering and go home. \u201d Reagan declared \u201c we dishonor the memory of the 50,000 young Americans who died in that cause when we give way to feelings of guilt as if we were doing something shameful . \u201d\nReagan told the VFW that was the \u201c lesson for all of us on Vietnam . If we are forced to fight , we must have the means and the determination to prevail or we will not have what it takes to secure the peace . \u201d\nTwo months ago , Trump made the case to \u201c Afghanize \u201d the fight . The president said Afghan troops would bear \u201c the heaviest burden \u201d in this struggle . He also spoke of the thousands of U.S. troops who \u201c fought and died in Afghanistan. \u201d Trump suggested the U.S. needs to remain engaged in Afghanistan \u201c to secure the cause for which they gave their lives . \u201d\nVietnam was a seminal period in the American experience . It \u2019 s natural to draw parallels between Vietnam and other lengthy military engagements . The U.S. has now been in Afghanistan since shortly after 9\/11 .\nHow long should the U.S. stay ? Ironically , military analysts now believe Vietnam isn \u2019 t the model to which people should look when discussing Afghanistan . They note how long the U.S. has remained on the Korean Peninsula .\nThis is ironic . Consider the fact that the 60-plus year U.S. presence there hasn \u2019 t inhibited the possibility of the U.S. facing off with Pyongyang in a nuclear war . Those chances are now as high as ever .\nIn June , the president submitted to Congress a report detailing all of the places the U.S. is involved militarily ( most are listed above ) , information about deployments and justifications for the operations . Most of these missives from the administration to Congress contain a crucial phrase .\nThe letter states the information the president is sending to Capitol Hill is \u201c consistent with the War Powers Resolution , as part of my efforts to keep Congress informed about deployments of the U.S. Armed Forces equipped for combat . \u201d\nNote it states \u201c consistent with \u201d the resolution . The letter doesn \u2019 t state \u201c in compliance with. \u201d No administration of either party has truly acknowledged the resolution since its adoption in 1974 .\nArticle I , Section 8 of the Constitution grants Congress the power to declare war . Article II , Section 2 of the Constitution names the president commander in chief . Congress created the resolution as an additional check on the president to curb his war-making authority . This effort backfired as Congress inadvertently ceded more latitude to the president .\nSo short of declaring war somewhere , presidents simply slip Congress a note at regular intervals as to what the U.S. is doing where . Constitutional ? Unclear . \u201c Adhering \u201d to the War Powers Resolution ? Not really . \u201c Consistent with \u201d the resolution ? You bet .\nThink the U.S. is at \u201c war \u201d in Niger ? Then why are there four dead Americans there and what were they doing there ?\nTrump \u2019 s June letter spells it all out . The president told lawmakers that \u201c United States military personnel in the Lake Chad Basin continue to provide a wide variety of support to African partners conducting counterterrorism operations in the region . In Niger , there are about 645 U.S. military personnel deployed to support these missions .\nIn Cameroon , roughly 300 U.S. military personnel are also deployed , the bulk of whom are supporting United States airborne intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance operations in the region . These forces are equipped with weapons for the purpose of providing their own force protection and security , and they will remain in Cameroon , with the consent of the government of Cameroon , until their support is no longer needed . \u201d\n\u201c The operation has caused us to begin to re-examine force protection in Niger , \u201d said Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed , the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee . \u201c We have to re-evaluate what we \u2019 re doing there . \u201d\nFew Americans even knew the U.S. was involved in Niger . Sen. Rand Paul , Kentucky , trolled fellow GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham on Twitter after the South Carolina senator told NBC he wasn \u2019 t fully aware of U.S. military operations there .\n\u201c You know you are in too many wars in too many places when even warmonger Lindsay Graham can \u2019 t keep track anymore , \u201d Paul tweeted .\nThis is why Sen. Tim Kaine , D-Va. , has long argued that the 2001 and 2002 authorizations Congress approved for wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are calcified . He \u2019 s pushed for a retrenched Authorization for Use of Military Force ( AUMF ) for years now .\n\u201c We were in Niger to deal with an ISIS threat , \u201d Kaine said . \u201c It \u2019 s time for Congress to finally revisit the authorization which is badly out of date and have a debate on full view of the American public about all the different countries where we are in engaged in military action right now . \u201d\nLawmakers of both parties have flirted with such a proposal for several years . Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker , R-Tenn. , convenes a hearing Monday about a potential new AUMF with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis .\n\u201c It is perhaps more important than ever that we have a sober national conversation about Congress \u2019 s Constitutional role in authorizing the use of military force , \u201d Corker said .\nCongress felt it was in the dark a few weeks ago about what went down in Niger and demanded more information from the Pentagon . Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain , R-Ariz. , threatened to subpoena military officials after they were less than forthcoming about Niger .\nThat prompted Mattis to pay McCain a courtesy call at his office . When asked in the hall if he hustled to Capitol Hill because of McCain \u2019 s subpoena warning , Mattis stopped in his tracks in a corridor of the Russell Senate Office Building .\nThe Defense secretary than ventured over to talk with Graham . After that conclave , Graham offered perhaps the most sober assessment yet about U.S. involvement overseas and perhaps why Congress is mulling a new AUMF .\n\u201c This war is getting hot in places where it \u2019 s been cool , \u201d he said about the broader war on terrorism .\n\u201c The war is beginning to morph , \u201d Graham also said , noting that there would be more -- \u201c not less \u201d -- operations like the one in Niger .\nSo the U.S. finds itself in Niger and Mali and Cameroon and Chad and the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo and a host of other places few Americans have ever heard of -- to say nothing about Syria , Iraq and Afghanistan .\nThe perfect solution would be the \u201c Vietnamization \u201d of these conflicts as suggested so long ago by Defense Secretary Melvin Laird . But with the U.S. now committed all over the globe , it \u2019 s pretty clear the opposite happened . These battles are now \u201c Americanized . \u201d","bias":2}

Bob Goodlatte ( R. , Va. ) and Michael McCaul ( R. , Texas ) , and a compromise bill that was the subject of weeks of negotiations . The options being considered as part of a compromise include the creation of a new merit-based green card program that would reward immigrants for meeting certain benchmarks to allow them to eventually become citizens .\nPresident Donald Trump ended the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals , or DACA , program and has repeatedly called on Congress to replace it with legislation .\n\u201c It will be a merit-based system and we \u2019 ll release what those merits are , \u201d said Rep. Jeff Denham ( R. , Calif. ) , who was part of the negotiations . \u201c But certainly those that came out of the shadows and did what the government asked them to do , their time in the DACA program will count toward this as well . \u201d\nBut even members who were part of the negotiations were reluctant to commit their support for the deal on Wednesday . Florida Rep. Carlos Curbelo , one of the centrist Republicans involved in negotiations , said he was waiting to see the legislative text to decide whether to support it .\nNorth Carolina Rep.

A bill reflecting the president \u2019 s priorities failed in the Senate in February in a 39-60 vote , with 14 Republicans opposed . Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R. , Ky. ) has said he has no desire to spend time on bills that are bound to fail .\nMr. Trump has said legal protections for hundreds of thousands of so-called Dreamers , young people brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents , must be paired with tighter border security , including funding for a wall along the Mexican border . He also wants curbs to the family-based migration system and an end to the diversity visa lottery , which admits 50,000 people chosen at random from underrepresented countries .\nThe border security provisions in the compromise bill are the same as those in the bill from Mssrs . McCaul and Goodlatte , according to Mr. Curbelo ( R. , Fla. ) , who was also part of the negotiations . The compromise legislation eliminates the diversity visa lottery system and changes family-based immigration , though Mr. Denham said those specifics were not ironed out .\nExcluded from the bill are provisions overhauling the guest-worker program and a federal e-verify program .

{"id":"N5FeEAyJlQbmIazm","content":"Iowa 's largest newspaper is in the middle of a firestorm after publishing a report that dug up old , offensive tweets from a local man who raised over $ 1 million he then donated to charity .\nA piece published by the Des Moines Register profiled a 24-year-old Iowan native , Carson King , who became a TV sensation last weekend after he held up a sign at a football game asking people to donate money to him . He requested that they donate the funds through Venmo so he could buy his `` supply '' of Busch Light .\nKing went on to raise more than $ 1 million and donated the money to the University of Iowa 's Stead Children 's Hospital . Busch Light and Venmo pledged to match King 's fundraising efforts .\nThe newspaper report , however , included a `` routine background check '' of King 's social media history . Register reporter Aaron Calvin came across two racist jokes that dated back to 2012 when King was a 16-year-old high school student , `` one comparing black mothers to gorillas and another making light of black people killed in the Holocaust . ''\nKing was asked about the tweets and immediately expressed remorse .\n`` That \u2019 s not something that I \u2019 m proud of at all , '' King told the Register on Tuesday .\nHe appeared on local TV stations to apologize and said , `` I am embarrassed and stunned to reflect on what I thought was funny when I was 16 years old . ''\nNYT REPORTERS BEHIND KAVANAUGH STORY SUGGEST KEY INFORMATION WAS REMOVED BY EDITORS\nIn light of the tweets , Busch Light 's parent company , Anheuser-Busch InBev , announced that it was severing ties with King but promised to honor its pledge .\nAfter the piece was published Tuesday evening , critics slammed the Register for digging up the tweets .\nThe Register 's Executive Editor Carol Hunter issued a statement responding to the backlash and shed some light on the internal discussion about whether to include details about King 's social media posts .\n`` Should that material be included in the profile at all ? The jokes were highly inappropriate and were public posts . Should n't that be acknowledged to all the people who had donated money to King 's cause or were planning to do so ? '' Hunter wrote .\nHunter went on to defend the paper 's decision to include such information , noting that it was toward the bottom of the profile and not placed prominently at the top .\n`` The news conference was covered by local television stations , which first reported on the racist posts and King 's remorse . After those stories aired , Busch Light 's parent company announced it would honor its pledge to the children 's hospital but would sever future ties with King , '' Hunter continued . `` That happened before the Register published its profile of King , which was still in the editing process . ''\nWHO-TV 's Keith Murphy reported late Tuesday night that King found out at 2:16 p.m. local time that Busch Light was severing ties with him and that the press conference he held was n't until 7 p.m. , which appears to differ from Hunter 's claim that local television stations were the `` first '' to report about the tweets .\nThis also suggests that the tweets were brought to the beer company 's attention before King made public statements about them . And fingers were being pointed at the Register by critics .\nAfter the piece stirred up controversy on social media , critics then performed a `` routine background check '' on reporter Aaron Calvin 's social media footprint and found several insensitive tweets of his own .\nIn now-deleted tweets from 2010-2013 , Calvin repeatedly used the N-word , and wrote posts attacking law enforcement like `` f -- - all cops , '' and in reaction to the legalization of gay marriage said he 's `` totally going to marry a horse . ''\nBefore locking his Twitter account , Calvin issued an apology for his own tweets .\n`` Hey just wanted to say that I have deleted previous tweets that have been inappropriate or insensitive . I apologize for not holding myself to the same standards as the Register holds others , '' Calvin wrote .\nThe Register later tweeted that it was `` aware of reports of inappropriate social media posts '' by Calvin and an `` investigation has begun . ''\nCalvin and the paper did not immediately respond to \u2588\u2588\u2588 ' request for comment .\nDespite the uproar , King defended the paper and its reporter .\n`` The Des Moines Register has been nothing but kind in all of their coverage , and I appreciate the reporter pointing out the post to me , '' King tweeted . `` I want everyone to understand that this was my decision to publicly address the posts and apologize . I believe that is the right thing to do . ''\nIn a statement to \u2588\u2588\u2588 , King expressed that he did n't want `` any of this negativity to hinder with the amazing work everyone has done for the hospital . ''","bias":2}
{"id":"fO67Kzzu04EuDhy5","content":"Chants of `` Trump ! Trump ! Trump ! '' and talk of removing Muslims from the country may be par for the course at the Republican presidential candidate 's campaign rallies .\nBut what happens when those chants take place inside a school cafeteria ?\nAdministrators at Jericho Elementary School in Centereach , N.Y. , responded to that question this week by canceling the school 's mock presidential election , replacing the candidates on the ballot with a less divisive poll of favorite school lunches . Students ' rhetoric around Donald Trump , Hillary Clinton , and minority groups had become too extreme , principal Glen Rogers told local TV station ABC 7 in explanation of the decision , `` and there were some negative things said . ''\nAt a time when polls show partisan polarization in the United States at a record high , the question of how , or even whether , to engage students in this year 's presidential election is not unique to Jericho . A certain amount of political polarization inevitably trickles down into schools during election season , education experts say . But the 2016 presidential race , with its racially-charged rhetoric , sexual assault and email malfeasance allegations , protests that turned violent , and two historically unpopular candidates , has elicited new levels of emotion among adults and children alike , leaving teachers and administrators to grapple with how to promote civic engagement while maintaining civility in the classroom .\n`` Preparing citizens who are able to engage in civic discourse and have a certain level of political tolerance is an important part of the role of public schools in a democracy , and there are important opportunities for students to learn during critical moments , like now , in US history , '' says Laura May , an associate professor of early childhood and elementary education at Georgia State University , in a phone interview with The \u2588\u2588\u2588 . `` But in times like now , in the midst of heated and extreme views that are often uncompromising , teachers and schools are vulnerable . ''\nThe fear of dividing or offending students appears to be a common theme among educators : A study by the Southern Poverty Law Center in April found that more than 40 percent of roughly 2,000 teachers surveyed said they were hesitant to teach about the election .\nTeachers are `` really wrestling with this , '' Meira Levinson , a professor at Harvard University \u2019 s Graduate School of Education , told The Atlantic in July . `` How do they distinguish between political talk and partisan talk ? How much of it should they allow ? Is it right for students to try to convince each other of their views ? ''\nBut some argue that the heated \u2013 and , oftentimes , debatably offensive \u2013 rhetoric of the election is all the more reason for educators to engage their students in political discourse .\n`` The language of violence and hate that has been stirred up around this election makes it more delicate , tough and fearful to have conversations , but that \u2019 s exactly why it \u2019 s so important to have them , '' said Diane Douglas , executive director of Seattle CityClub , a non-partisan group that focuses on civic engagement , to KING 5 News in Seattle . `` We should to try to model for children how to talk about difference of experiences , race and point of view in a civil , respectful way . ''\nHow , exactly , does one facilitate such a discussion ? The first step , Professor May says , is ensuring that children feel safe , comfortable , and respected enough among their peers to share personal , and possibly unpopular , opinions . Once a community environment has been established , she suggests , students and teachers can work together to develop ground rules for political discussions : `` what 's OK , and what 's not . '' For younger children , May says , it may be best to discuss the election in terms of familiar concepts , such as kindness and fairness .\nBut when discussing candidates who many disagree with not only politically but also morally , framing the election in moral terms also requires a more nuanced approach .\n`` The key '' to discussing the moral implications of candidates ' words or actions without alienating student supporters , writes Wayne Journell , an associate professor of social studies education at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro , `` is that teachers have to be purposeful in how they frame questions and take firm stands on issues that are\/should be 'settled , ' or not controversial , and allow for tolerant discourse on issues that are 'open ' on which multiple , rational opinions exist . ''\nFor example , he tells the Monitor in an email , rather than prompting a discussion on whether Mr. Trump 's controversial comments on women in a leaked 2005 Access Hollywood video are morally acceptable , teachers should ask whether the remarks are grounds to disqualify him from the presidency . Or , rather than debating the truthfulness in Trump 's allusion to Mexican immigrants as rapists , discuss specific policies related to that statement .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox . By signing up , you agree to our Privacy Policy\nWhile the content and nature of the discussions may vary depending on school , location , and grade level , the most important thing , Professor Journell believes , is providing a model and channel for civil discourse in the classroom \u2013 something that can not be achieved through censorship .\nRather than canceling mock elections or avoiding classroom discussions , Journell says , administrators should `` address the problem by using it as a teachable moment that addresses what types of political discourse should be expected within a democracy . Regardless of where one stands politically , being able to tolerantly deliberate issues with those who have divergent views is a skill that needs to be modeled and practiced , and schools have a responsibility to aid in that development .

That outlet was prominently in the news this week thanks to its \u201c bombshell \u201d story about President Trump and Michael Cohen : a story that , like so many others of its kind , blew up in its face , this time when the typically mute Robert Mueller \u2019 s office took the extremely rare step to label its key claims \u201c inaccurate. \u201d But in homage to BuzzFeed \u2019 s past viral glory , following are the top ten worst media failures in two-plus-years of Trump\/Russia reporting . They are listed in reverse order , as measured by the magnitude of the embarrassment , the hysteria they generated on social media and cable news , the level of journalistic recklessness that produced them , and the amount of damage and danger they caused . This list was extremely difficult to compile in part because news outlets ( particularly CNN and MSNBC ) often delete from the internet the video segments of their most embarrassing moments . Even more challenging was the fact that the number of worthy nominees is so large that highly meritorious entrees had to be excluded , but are acknowledged at the end with ( dis ) honorable mention status . Note that all of these \u201c errors \u201d go only in one direction : namely , exaggerating the grave threat posed by Moscow and the Trump circle \u2019 s connection to it . It \u2019 s inevitable that media outlets will make mistakes on complex stories . If that \u2019 s being done in good faith , one would expect the errors would be roughly 50\/50 in terms of the agenda served by the false stories . That is most definitely not the case here . Just as was true in 2002 and 2003 , when the media clearly wanted to exaggerate the threat posed by Saddam Hussein and thus all of its \u201c errors \u201d went in that direction , virtually all of its major \u201c errors \u201d in this story are devoted to the same agenda and script : 10 .

Donald Trump Jr. Was Offered Advanced Access to the WikiLeaks Email Archive ( CNN\/MSNBC ) The morning of December 9 , 2017 , launched one of the most humiliating spectacles in the history of the U.S. media . With a tone so grave and bombastic that it is impossible to overstate , CNN went on the air and announced a major exclusive : Donald Trump , Jr. was offered by email advanced access to the trove of DNC and Podesta emails published by WikiLeaks \u2013 meaning before those emails were made public . Within an hour , MSNBC \u2019 s Ken Dilanian , using a tone somehow even more unhinged , purported to have \u201c independently confirmed \u201d this mammoth , blockbuster scoop , which , they said , would have been the smoking gun showing collusion between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks over the hacked emails ( while the YouTube clips have been removed , you can still watch one of the amazing MSNBC videos here ) . There was , alas , just one small problem with this massive , blockbuster story : it was totally and completely false . The email which Trump , Jr. received that directed him to the WikiLeaks archive was sent after WikiLeaks published it online for the whole world to see , not before . Rather than some super secretive operative giving Trump , Jr. advanced access , as both CNN and MSNBC told the public for hours they had confirmed , it was instead just some totally pedestrian message from a random member of the public suggesting Trump , Jr. review documents the whole world was already talking about . All of the anonymous sources CNN and MSNBC cited somehow all got the date of the email wrong . To date , when asked how they both could have gotten such a massive story so completely wrong in the same way , both CNN and MSNBC have adopted the posture of the CIA by maintaining complete silence and refusing to explain how it could possibly be that all of their \u201c multiple , independent sources \u201d got the date wrong on the email in the same way , to be as incriminating \u2013 and false \u2013 as possible . Nor , needless to say , will they identify their sources who , in concert , fed them such inflammatory and utterly false information . Sadly , CNN and MSNBC have deleted most traces of the most humiliating videos from the internet , including demanding that YouTube remove copies . But enough survives to document just what a monumental , horrifying , and utterly inexcusable debacle this was . Particularly amazing is the clip of the CNN reporter ( see below ) having to admit the error for the first time , as he awkwardly struggles to pretend that it \u2019 s not the massive , horrific debacle that it so obviously is :\nKnowingly soliciting or receiving anything of value from a foreign national for campaign purposes violates the Federal Election Campaign Act .

They expect the government to revise the numbers higher in the months ahead .\n`` Just about every other measure of job growth suggests that employers are either hiring or intending to hire , extending hours and laying off fewer people , '' said Tim Hopper , chief economist for TIAA-CREF .\n`` Let 's not panic , '' said Heidi Hartmann , president of the Institute for Women 's Policy Research , adding that `` it 's not a horrible year , all things considered . ''\nThe government also noted that `` unusually cold weather in parts of the country '' could have had some impact on construction jobs for example . That sector lost 16,000 jobs in December .\nMeanwhile , the unemployment rate fell to 6.7 % in December , but the drop came mainly from workers leaving the labor force .\nJob market dropouts could be doing other things , like retiring , enrolling in educational programs or taking care of relatives . But many have simply given up hope of finding work .\nOnly 62.8 % of the adult population is participating in the labor market now -- meaning they either have a job or are looking for one . That matches the lowest level since 1978 .\nIn the job market 's 2007 heyday , unemployment was under 5 % , but in the two years that followed , the recession wiped out 8.7 million jobs . To this day , not all those jobs have returned .\n`` We 're going to have a long-term unemployment crisis for a long time , '' said Heidi Shierholz , economist with the Economic Policy Institute .\nAlong those lines , CNNMoney has talked to several people who have been unemployed for a while . Jamie May has been looking for a job for more than a year . Formerly a senior manager for a corporate housing company , she had a comfortable six-figure salary before the recession hit . But since then has been laid off three times .\n`` There are days I 'm numb , '' she said . `` The mental toll -- the depression -- the feeling of being unworthy and unwanted , after being highly successful . I just want a job . ''\nBased in Austin , Texas , she has submitted applications for positions around the country , and has even indicated she would be willing to take jobs in the $ 30,000 to $ 40,000 range .\n`` The feedback is -- 'you 're great , you have the credentials , but we want someone who knows the local market . ' Or , ' we 're concerned you 'll leave when the economy picks up and you get a better offer , ' '' she said .\nFred Royal in Houston used to work as an administrative assistant for a grocery chain . He lost his job in March , and gets the same message in interviews .\n`` Many have said they think I will leave for a better paying job , '' he said . `` Better paying job ? I ca n't even get one job . ''\nBoth May and Royal were among the 1.3 million Americans who received their final check in federal unemployment benefits last week after Congress agreed on a budget that left out the recession-era program . Democrats are pushing for an extension of the program , but Republicans insist on finding a way to pay for it through cost-cutting elsewhere .\nThe haggling over budget cuts versus aid to the still fragile economy exemplifies the ongoing tension between Washington policymakers .\nWhile Congress has largely focused on reducing government spending , the Federal Reserve has been pumping trillions of dollars into the economy in an attempt to help the job market .\nFed Chairman Ben Bernanke will end his second term at the central bank later this month without reaching his goal of `` full employment . ''\n`` The recovery clearly remains incomplete , '' he said in a speech last week , blaming part of the problem on government policy . `` Excessively tight near-term fiscal policies have likely been counterproductive , '' he said .\nThe federal government has cut 98,000 jobs over the past three years , not including the Postal Service , which is independently funded but has also been slashing jobs . The Postal Service workforce is around its lowest level since the 1960s .\nMark Zandi , chief economist at Moody 's Analytics forecasts it could take until the end of 2016 to get to a 5.5 % unemployment rate . Shierholz calculates it could take even longer to get to a pre-recession job market -- when unemployment was below 5 % .\n`` Even if we did have 200,000 jobs a month , we would need five years to get there , '' she said .\nAre you unemployed ?

It just put us under arrest . \u201d\nsee also Army reportedly giving immigrant enlistees the boot The Army is booting reservists and recruits who happen to ...\nHe is one of dozens of recruits whom the Army has discharged in recent months with little explanation since the Trump administration last year disbanded the Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest , or MAVNI , program that was designed to recruit highly skilled legal immigrants like Zhang into the armed forces .\nStringent new background checks meant many of the recruits couldn \u2019 t get cleared for basic training \u2014 for reasons many still don \u2019 t know .\nA July 20 Army memo made public Thursday by The Associated Press revealed officials have been ordered to stop processing such discharges .\nBut it \u2019 s unclear what that means for those who haven \u2019 t been cleared or would-be soldiers like Zhang who have already been given their marching orders .\nFor now , they \u2019 re stuck in a dangerous limbo \u2014 because returning to their native countries after joining the US military could be a death sentence .\nThat was the dilemma facing Brooklynite Yousuf Istajab : risk his student-visa status expiring while he was awaiting clearance for basic training , or return to his native Pakistan and face persecution for joining the US Army Reserves .\n\u201c I can \u2019 t take the risk of my life and go back while serving in the Army , \u201d said Istajab , 33 .\nHe chose to file for asylum in the US as a last resort , marking a growing trend of US military members fearing deportation to countries where they could be treated as traitors .\nImmigration lawyers say they are being swamped by immigrants in the armed services desperate for help to stay in their adopted country .\n\u201c It \u2019 s crazy , \u201d said Margaret Stock , a retired Army Reserve lieutenant colonel who helped create the MAVNI program and has filed a dozen asylum cases so far .\n\u201c They are in the US military , and now they have to claim asylum in America . They should have legal status , and they should have citizenship . \u201d\nMaurice Goldman , an immigration attorney in Tucson , Ariz. , filed two asylum cases recently for immigrants who signed contracts with the military but now are at risk for deportation to countries where they will be persecuted .\n\u201c These are people who were given a raw deal , \u201d Goldman said .\n\u201c They agreed to assist the US military and put their own life at potential risk and defend our freedoms in return for the possibility of US citizenship . . . I believe that the US government breached their contract by not standing up to its end of the bargain . \u201d\nNeither the Pentagon nor the US Citizenship and Immigration Services could provide information on how many military members have resorted to seeking asylum .\nAfter pledging an oath to the United States , Zhang , too , fears going back to his native country could mean persecution for his family .\nHe initially came to America legally to pursue a higher education and better opportunities . His girlfriend later followed , and they were married in New York , where their son was born .\nZhang joined the immigrant-recruitment program to earn citizenship and had planned to serve in the Army for 20 years .\nsee also Veterans respond to Army discharging immigrant recruits Military veterans said it \u2019 s a slap in the face that ...\nFor more than two years , he attended weekly meetings for future Army soldiers to meet with his recruiter and to train , while his ship date to basic training got delayed due to the new background check process .\nBut with the US suddenly canceling his Army contract and his deferred-action status expiring , Zhang and his wife face deportation .\n\u201c We chose the MAVNI program because it can guarantee us citizenship within six months after I sign a contract , \u201d Zhang said .\n\u201c Two years later , they just threw me away and put me through a deportation process . \u201d\nThe MAVNI program was developed in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks to diversify the armed forces and bring in much-needed language skills .\nAbout 10,000 immigrants joined as a shortcut to US citizenship , but over the years , the program fell under increased scrutiny and oversight , and finally last year , the Pentagon suspended the program entirely .\nThe Department of Defense also changed the rules to require recruits who were still in the pipeline to undergo special new background checks before shipping out and warned that these checks could take more than a year to complete .\nRecruits must sit without access to a phone or computer for a daylong interview during which investigators grill them about every aspect of their life .\nThey must document their foreign travel since birth , their financial information and spending habits , a list of all associates \u201c living or dead \u201d who have been connected with any government and detailed information on \u201c all foreign-born associates and relatives \u201d they have ever had contact with , according to the manual for the counterintelligence screenings reviewed by The Post .\n\u201c The type of background check they are trying to get the noncitizen soldier to pass is as if he was going to be Jared Kushner working in the White House , \u201d said Zhang \u2019 s attorney , Beverly Cutler .\n\u201c They are giving them our nation \u2019 s highest level of national security testing and to not pass that has nothing to do with whether you are qualified to be a citizen . \u201d\nThe Pentagon didn \u2019 t have information on how many recruits passed the new standards , but it contends that the average ratio of passage is two out of three and that the tougher standards were needed for national security .\n\u201c The problem with the MAVNI program [ is ] we found that it was really vulnerable to insider threats and espionage and terrorism and other criminal activity . When that became apparent , we had to do something , \u201d said Pentagon spokeswoman Maj. Carla Gleason .\nShe said the Pentagon doesn \u2019 t tip off immigration officials to newly discharged immigrant recruits to start deportation proceedings .\n\u201c No one is being discharged from the military due to their immigration status . They are being discharged due to security suitability , \u201d she said .\nNew rules also drastically limited citizenship opportunities for all noncitizen recruits .\nPreviously , one day of military service was sufficient to apply for citizenship . But under the new rules , 180 days of consecutive active duty service or one year in the reserves is required .\n\u201c They welcome you . They say you are in our department and you are a US solider . We took an oath of office , \u201d said Istajab , who is working as a dental assistant .\n\u201c We were about to ship [ to basic training ] . And then all of a sudden , the new government came and said , \u2018 Hey , we don \u2019 t know who you guys are . . . You are strangers in our department. \u2019 It \u2019 s kind of rough . \u201d\nOne Chinese MAVNI recruit from New York learned that he didn \u2019 t pass an expanded background check \u2014 although not why \u2014 but hasn \u2019 t been officially discharged and is continuing to drill on weekends in his uniform in the hope the Army realizes he poses no threat .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t have a ship date . I \u2019 m just waiting . I \u2019 m hoping they change their mind or they made a mistake , \u201d said the recruit , who has been drilling for more than two years .\nIn China , his decision to serve in the US Army would be viewed as \u201c treason . \u201d\nEvidence compiled by Stock in a separate military asylum case shows a string of threats posted on the Chinese social media platform Sina Weibo against Chinese MAVNI soldiers .\n\u201c They betrayed their own country , \u201d one threat said . \u201c Kill them ! \u201d","bias":2}

Taxpayers in the bottom quintile of the income distribution would see a $ 412 bigger tax bill . For the top 0.1 percent , the average increase would be $ 633,946 .\nOnly a small handful of policy voices on the left are making the case for the tax cuts to fully expire . In part , that is because the economy is still growing slowly , and tax increases have the potential to weaken it . But it is also partly because of structural changes in the economy .\n\u201c This is about math and values , \u201d Senator Max Baucus , a Montana Democrat and the chairman of the Finance Committee , said in an e-mail . \u201c Our first priority needs to be extending tax cuts for the middle class . At a time when we need to cut our debt and are asking everyone to chip in , we simply can \u2019 t afford to continue extending all of the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans . \u201d\nThe Congressional Budget Office has found that between 1979 and 2007 , the top 1 percent of households saw their inflation-adjusted income grow 275 percent . For the bottom 20 percent , it grew just 18 percent , and federal tax and transfer programs also did less and less to reduce income inequality over that period .\nThe mounting concentration of wealth is even more dramatic . A recent Economic Policy Institute study found that between 1983 and 2010 about three-quarters of all new wealth accrued to the wealthiest 5 percent of households .

Aides say the position stems in part from his belief that long-term economic changes have rewarded the rich and punished many others .\nBut limiting tax increases to just a small fraction of households might mean raising too little revenue over the long term to finance the programs that Democrats also fiercely want to preserve \u2014 Social Security , Medicaid and Medicare , education , supports for lower-income working families and infrastructure , among others , some policy experts on the left say .\n\u201c It \u2019 s perfectly reasonable for the White House to begin collecting more revenue from folks who have done by far the best in pretax terms , \u201d said Jared Bernstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , a former economist for Vice President Joseph R.

{"id":"06gcWQ2Cz7bo6Rby","content":"For now , the 1997 land mine treaty that prohibits use and development is \u201c surviving and thriving , \u201d says Mary Wareham of Human Rights Watch . \u201c 164 countries are signatories , and there have been more every year since the treaty was created . They \u2019 re not going to tolerate any land mine use , and we \u2019 re not going to stop the monitoring that we do . \u201d\nHuman rights groups and some former military officers are among those who are not as convinced that land mines are necessary to bolster American defense . As recently as 2016 , an average of 23 people were killed or injured every day by land mines , with 78 % of victims being civilians .\nIn late January , the Trump administration rescinded a U.S. prohibition against anti-personnel mines , citing their power as a deterrent . In addition , the Pentagon can now \u201c turn to our industries to start developing land mines that are even more reliable , \u201d said acting Assistant Secretary of Defense Victorino Mercado .\nWith an estimated failure rate of 6 in 1 million , \u201c smart \u201d land mines are supposed to deactivate after a period of time . It \u2019 s a safety feature that the U.S. Defense Department highlights as one reason land mines should be back on the table .\nAfter being banned from planting land mines since 2014 , the United States military can now use them once again , and Victorino Mercado admits it \u2019 s \u201c a very emotional subject \u201d \u2013 including within the halls of the Pentagon .\nThat said , \u201c we \u2019 re not talking about what you see on TV , \u201d added Mr. Mercado , the acting assistant secretary of defense for strategy , plans , and capabilities , during a Pentagon briefing last month . The prohibitions against the old tripwire and pressure-plate land mines that have \u201c really wreaked havoc \u201d remain in place , and any newly deployed land mines must have safeguards to protect civilians . \u201c If we were n't comfortable ... that we can mitigate the risk to our forces and ensure that we minimize civilian casualties , then we would n't probably put this policy in place . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s that \u201c probably \u201d that has prompted unease among some former U.S. military generals and an outcry from human rights groups . Their concerns hinge in part on just how effective the \u201c safety valves \u201d for modern land mines are . Even granting technological advances , opponents argue that they don \u2019 t justify bringing back weapons of war that nonetheless remain indiscriminate .\nAs recently as 2016 , an average of 23 people were killed or injured every day by land mines , according to the International Campaign to Ban Landmines , which notes that the vast majority of victims \u2013 78 % \u2013 are civilians .\nThe Obama administration decided that while it wouldn \u2019 t sign the 1997 international treaty banning anti-personnel land mines \u2013 known as the Ottawa Convention \u2013 it would abide by its requirements , except on the Korean Peninsula . Commanders there lobbied to retain the capability to counter the threat of hundreds of thousands of North Korean troops and armored trucks ready to pour over the border .\nThe White House statement rescinding the ban authorizes four-star military commanders \u201c in exceptional circumstances \u201d \u2013 and with the express approval of the secretary of defense , according to Mr. Mercado \u2013 \u201c to employ advanced , non-persistent landmines specifically designed to reduce unintended harm to civilians . \u201d\nModern land mine designs include a deactivation mechanism , which is supposed to kick in after a period of time , between , say , 12 hours and 60 days . The minefields are also \u201c smart , \u201d in that they can \u201c talk to each other and be command-activated , and link into other sensors so that they know when enemy formations are coming , \u201d says retired Col. Mark Cancian , senior adviser in the International Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , who previously worked on land mine issues at the Pentagon .\nBut reducing the threat does not mean eliminating it , notes a U.S. Campaign to Ban Landmines statement released last week by 63 nongovernmental organizations that came together to condemn the policy . \u201c If the self-destruct or self-deactivation mechanisms were to fail , they would remain lethal , and the potential exists for the components to be repurposed into improvised explosive devices , \u201d it says . \u201c While there are still too many casualties annually , we have seen a dramatic decline since the Treaty came into being . To roll back the progress the global community has made would not only be a tragedy but an affront to the dignity of landmine survivors . \u201d\nMr. Cancian argues that cameras and infrared heat signature sensors can help to bring real-time surveillance of minefields . And more generally , he places a high degree of trust in the technology . \u201c I have a great deal of confidence that they \u2019 ll do what they say they will , \u201d he says . Pentagon officials say the odds that the mines will fail to self-deactivate as they \u2019 ve been programmed to do is 6 in 1 million .\n\u201c That \u2019 s pretty good . Can we make it better ? We can make it better. \u201d said Mr. Mercado , who added that besides the land mines that it already has stockpiled \u2013 most of which will expire in 2030 \u2013 the Pentagon can now \u201c turn to our industries to start developing land mines that are even more reliable . \u201d\nThis acknowledgment of room for improvement , however , points to the underlying threat that even the most recent land mine technology poses to civilians , says Mary Wareham , advocacy director of the Arms Division at Human Rights Watch . \u201c I \u2019 ve heard land mines called everything from \u2018 safe \u2019 to \u2018 pure \u2019 to \u2018 area denial systems. \u2019 There \u2019 s definitely been efforts by the defense sector to make more precise and accurate weapons . We \u2019 ve seen that with the more sophisticated cluster weapons that do not leave many unexploded remnants \u2013 but they still leave some . \u201d\nEven when the U.S. military \u201c is out there laying down so-called \u2018 nonpersistent smart mines \u2019 that will time out after 30 days , there \u2019 s still a field of mines out there , \u201d adds Stephen Pomper , senior director for policy at the International Crisis Group . \u201c Are U.S. troops going to be comfortable walking through there ? Are people going to send their children to play in them ? \u201d\nThe Trump administration argues that the greater risk is to U.S. national security . \u201c [ R ] estrictions imposed on American forces by the Obama Administration \u2019 s policy could place [ U.S. forces ] at a severe disadvantage during a conflict against our adversaries , \u201d according to the White House statement . \u201c The President is unwilling to accept this risk to our troops . \u201d\nAnalysts point out , however , that U.S. military leaders outside the Korean Peninsula haven \u2019 t been clamoring for land mines . Rather than in their underuse , the danger lies in their overuse , retired Gen. Carter Ham , former head of U.S. Africa Command , tells the Monitor . \u201c I think what we need to do is be very , very careful in the application of land mines . It \u2019 s kind of like nuclear weapons \u2013 we should never take anything off the table , but we should make sure we have very tight controls . \u201d\nThe current argument for land mines lies chiefly in their deterrent value \u2013 sowing uncertainty is a useful war tactic . They \u201c cause the adversary to have to pause and say , \u2018 Do I need to clear this field or not ? \u2019 \u201d Mr. Mercado said . This is particularly true , some analysts argue , against the backdrop of the Trump administration \u2019 s National Defense Strategy , which cites U.S. jockeying with \u201c great powers \u201d like China and Russia \u2013 neither of whom are Ottawa Convention signatories \u2013 as a bigger threat than terrorism .\nIn the event that Moscow decides to invade a neighbor , for example , \u201c a [ land mine ] capability like this would be very helpful to slow Russians until we bring in NATO , \u201d Mr. Cancian says . Yet in an era of drones , cyberwarfare , and hypersonic weapons , \u201c I guess I \u2019 m a little bit skeptical that if , God forbid , the U.S. were to end up in a ground war with Russia , \u201d Mr. Pomper adds , \u201c that the outcome would be determined by the availability of anti-personnel land mines . \u201d\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox .

He said he would be `` taking care '' of DACA and said the program would be `` just fine . '' He said he would be signing a `` big immigration bill , '' which he also called a `` big executive order , '' and said , `` I 'm going to make DACA a part of it .

It 's going to be a very big bill , a very good bill , and merit-based bill and it will include DACA , and I think people are going to be very happy .

That vote signaled that the core of the deal \u2014 to offer quick legal status and work permits to illegal immigrants but to withhold full citizenship rights until the border is considered secure \u2014 is holding .\nAnalysts on all sides of the issue have decried the Senate \u2019 s border surge , saying the money is unlikely to produce much of a return on the dollar .\nMs. Epstein and other opponents said building up the border with that many agents could cause a spike in human rights abuses . During a surge under the George W. Bush administration , the Department of Homeland Security struggled to hire and train Border Patrol agents .\nIn Congress , action has shifted to the House , where Republicans hold a majority . They will meet Wednesday to hash out their strategy .\nSeveral key differences have emerged \u2014 and none more critical than the approaches to a pathway to citizenship . Most Senate Republicans , including those who voted against the bill , agreed that a pathway is needed but fought over what conditions to attach to it .\nThat view is not universal among House Republicans , many of whom say that granting illegal immigrants citizenship is an amnesty for breaking the law .\nBeyond that fight , House Speaker John A. Boehner , Ohio Republican , has called the security provision in the Senate bill \u201c laughable. \u201d He has signaled that whatever the House does , it will go beyond the border buildup in the Senate legislation .\nIt \u2019 s not clear how much leverage immigrant rights groups will have in the House .\nWith House Republicans under pressure to strengthen the bill , many immigrant rights groups say the Senate bill is their high-water mark and they now will be playing chiefly defense . It \u2019 s one reason so many groups were upset that the Senate added border security rather than waiting to fight the issue with the House .\nBut some groups argue , at least publicly , that the House bill won \u2019 t necessarily be stronger than the Senate version .\nAccording to some reports , a bipartisan group of seven House lawmakers negotiating a deal may even be looking at a shorter path to citizenship than the one in the Senate agreement .\nRep. Raul R. Labrador , an Idaho Republican who used to be part of that bipartisan group of negotiators , said there is little doubt that the House bill will focus more on security than the Senate version .\n\u201c My concern with the Senate bill is that they put the legalization of 11 million people ahead of security . The legalization happens first , and then the security happens second , \u201d he told NBC \u2019 s \u201c Meet the Press \u201d program Sunday .\nHe said he doesn \u2019 t want a repeat of what he considers mistakes of implementing the president \u2019 s health care law by giving the administration a large amount of power .\nMr. Labrador said it would be a mistake to turn over border security decisions to the Obama administration .\nRep. Michael T. McCaul , Texas Republican and chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee , said on CBS \u2019 \u201c Face the Nation \u201d program that the House also wants to avoid another part of the health care debate , when the House took up and passed the Senate \u2019 s bill in its entirety , unchanged .\nSome Senate Democrats have predicted that the House will do that with the Senate immigration bill , but Mr. McCaul said that won \u2019 t happen .\nEarlier this year , he cleared a tough border security bill through his committee on a unanimous bipartisan vote , and he derided the Senate \u2019 s plan to add agents and fencing as throwing money at the problem .\n\u201c What the Senate just passed was , again , a bunch of , you know , candy thrown down there , a bunch of assets thrown down there to gain votes but without a methodical , smart border approach , \u201d he said . \u201c We want a smart border . We also want a smart immigration plan , something that makes sense . \u201d\nMr. McCaul said his own border security bill could be on the House floor later this month or in September .\nMs. Cadena from the Texas Alliance said she hasn \u2019 t given up hope that the House could ease some of the border provisions \u2014 particularly if groups pressure representatives at the local level .\n\u201c I think that people have pretty much given up that what we got in the Senate is the best we \u2019 re going to get , from now on it \u2019 s only going to get worse . There might be some truth to that , but those of us who are in the field out in Texas or other parts of the country , it \u2019 s too soon to make that determination , \u201d she said .\n\u201c At the end of the day , all politics is local . We \u2019 re trying to influence some of these members who may be in swing districts or may be in significant Latino population . \u201d","bias":2}

The White House was notified that the DOJ had received the report around 4:45 p.m. , before lawmakers on Capitol Hill were informed . Neither the White House nor Congress has seen the actual report .\nBoth Barr and Rosenstein have seen the report , according to a senior DOJ official .\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders tweeted following the report 's submission .\n`` The next steps are up to Attorney General Barr , and we look forward to the process taking its course , '' she said . `` The White House has not received or been briefed on the Special Counsel \u2019 s report . ''\nRudy Giuliani and Jay Sekulow , both of whom are counselors to Trump , also released a joint statement .\n\u201c We \u2019 re pleased that the Office of Special Counsel has delivered its report to the attorney general pursuant to the regulations , '' the statement said . `` Attorney General Barr will determine the appropriate next steps . \u201d\nFollowing word that Mueller was not recommending more indictments , Giuliani told Fox News that they were `` confident '' the investigation would show there was no collusion .\n\u201c This marks the end of the Russia investigation . We await a disclosure of the facts , '' he said . `` We are confident that there is no finding of collusion by the President and this underscores what the President has been saying from the beginning - that he did nothing wrong . \u201d\nSeveral lawmakers , including Sens .

''\nGraham released a statement , confirming that he and Feinstein had been informed of the report 's submission , which he said signaled that Barr `` will pursue as much transparency as possible .

None of Mueller \u2019 s findings were immediately released .\nThe president has repeatedly decried Mueller \u2019 s probe as a \u201c witch hunt , \u201d emphatically denying he or his campaign colluded with Russia to undermine Democrat Hillary Clinton \u2019 s chances in the 2016 race . The president has alleged a slew of internal \u201c conflicts of interest \u201d from Mueller \u2019 s team and has previously said his legal team is drafting a \u201c major counter report \u201d in response to its findings .\nMueller \u2019 s investigation , which was initially ordered to look into the 2016 election in May of 2017 , has gone on for almost two years . It has expanded to probe financial crimes of Trump associates before the election , conversations Trump \u2019 s national security adviser had with the Russians during the transition and whether Trump obstructed justice with his comments and actions related to the probe .\nMueller , the former director of the FBI under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama , was appointed special counsel by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in May of 2017 . In his order , Rosenstein directed Mueller to investigate any links or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign , as well as any other matters that arose from the investigation .\n\u201c If the Special Counsel believes it is necessary and appropriate , the Special Counsel is authorized to prosecute federal crimes arising from the investigation of these matters , \u201d Rosenstein wrote to Mueller .\nSince then , Mueller \u2019 s team has indicted , convicted , or won guilty pleas from 34 people and three companies as part of an investigation that has also probed issues unrelated to the 2016 campaign .\nTwenty six Russian nationals and three Russian companies have been charged with interfering in the 2016 presidential election .\nBut none of the Trump associates connected to Trump have been charged with crimes related to collusion , though Mueller \u2019 s team charged former Trump associate Roger Stone in January with lying about his communications with WikiLeaks , which published hacked Democratic emails during the election .\nOther convictions include : former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos , who both pleaded guilty to making false statements in 2017 .\nFormer campaign adviser Rick Gates in 2018 pleaded guilty and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort was convicted and later pleaded guilty in a separate financial crimes case dating back before the 2016 election .\nFormer Trump lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to making false statements in a case brought by Mueller in November .\nAlex van der Zwaan , a London-based lawyer , pleaded guilty to making false statements this year , and Richard Pinedo , a California man , pleaded guilty to identity fraud in 2018 .\nMueller has also looked at actions taken by Trump after he was sworn in as president , like his firing of FBI director James Comey and his ousting of Attorney General Jeff Sessions .\nSessions , once one of President Trump \u2019 s most loyal and trusted advisers infuriated Trump over his recusal from the Russia investigation . In March 2017 , Sessions announced his plans to recuse himself after reports surfaced detailing undisclosed conversations with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the campaign .\nRosenstein , Sessions \u2019 number two at the Justice Department , then took control of the investigation and decided to appoint Mueller to take over the probe .\nRosenstein said at the time , \u201c What I have determined is that based upon the unique circumstances the public interest requires me to place this investigation under the authority of a person who exercises a degree of independence from the normal chain of command . \u201d\nMueller said in a statement , upon his appointment : \u201c I accept this responsibility and will discharge it to the best of my ability . \u2019 \u2019\nRosenstein later ceded oversight to then-acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker when he took over for Sessions .

{"id":"idjVDJqvh4oiiK5b","content":"As Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with North Korean officials Saturday to discuss how to achieve the U.S. goal of denuclearization of the communist nation , the world was paying less attention to a related challenge : how to stop the North from continuing to sell nuclear capabilities and weapons to rogue regimes around the world .\nNorth Korea , struggling under crippling international economic sanctions , uses arms deals as an important source of millions of dollars in cash .\nEven if weapons and nuclear capabilities sold by the North are never used against the U.S. or our allies , they pose a danger to the world and can be used to kill and wound both foreign combatants and innocent civilians .\nA perfect example of the harm caused by North Korea \u2019 s arms sales can be found on the other side of the world in Sudan , where North Korea sells to the rogue regime of Omar Bashir .\nNorth Korea , struggling under crippling international economic sanctions , uses arms deals as an important source of millions of dollars in cash .\nSudan has long been a reliable customer for North Korean weapons . This relationship has been well-documented over the years , despite the fact that the 2006 U.N. Security Council Resolution 1718 prohibits the trade of weapons between North Korea and any U.N. member state .\nAccording to the U.N. Panel of Experts \u2019 February 2017 report on North Korea , in August 2013 Pyongyang supplied 100 precision-guided rocket control sections and 80 air attack satellite-guided missiles to Sudan , under two contracts worth over $ 6.4 million . The contracts were signed by the reputed president of North Korea \u2019 s primary arms dealer , KOMID .\nWeapons sales are beneficial for both sides , particularly in kleptocracies such as Sudan and North Korea . According to the 2017 Transparency International \u2019 s Corruption Perceptions Index , both North Korea and Sudan ranked among the 10 most corrupt countries in the world .\nMilitary sales often involve the transfer of millions of dollars in cash , which are susceptible to easy embezzlement by underpaid public officials involved in the transactions . A North Korean ambassador who defected stated that \u201c all the North Korean diplomats based overseas make extra income using all means possible . \u201d\nThe same is true on the Sudanese side . According to the GAN Business Anti-Corruption Portal , Sudanese government officials are \u201c frequently involved in corrupt practices with impunity . \u201d\nThe regime of Sudanese President Omar Bashir purchases heavy weaponry from North Korea to wage war on its own people , while individuals within his regime personally profit off the deals .\nUnder both President Obama and President Trump , the U.S. has designated Sudan as a state sponsor of terrorism . While American officials have known about Sudan \u2019 s weapons purchases from North Korea for many years , the Obama administration nonetheless began a bilateral engagement process with Sudan in June 2016 to improve relations .\nThe Obama policy required that Sudan make progress in five different areas of concern in exchange for relief from U.S. economic sanctions .\nThis \u201c five-track \u201d process culminated in October 2017 , when the Trump administration lifted longstanding financial sanctions on the Sudanese government . This came despite the lack of progress on key issues , such as stopping the government \u2019 s use of humanitarian aid as a weapon against rebel forces in the province of Darfur .\nSudan \u2019 s weapons relationship with North Korea continues , because none of the five criteria on which Sudan was measured required it to stop buying weapons from Pyongyang . In addition , the five criteria fail to address the government corruption that is destroying Sudan \u2019 s formal economy .\nIf North Korea and Sudan terminated their ongoing weapons deals they would remove a major stumbling block in their efforts to potentially normalize relations with Washington and attract international investment for their respective failing economies .\nYet Sudan continues its secretive transactions with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un \u2019 s weapons dealers . There is one clear incentive : greed .\nSystematic corruption in Sudan continues to drive the Bashir regime to provide much-needed income to Pyongyang in exchange for weapons .\nAt a minimum , the dirty arms deals between North Korea and Sudan should automatically disqualify Sudan for removal from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism , and should make further normalization of ties with the U.S. impossible .\nEven if Sudan \u2019 s military purchases from North Korea were to end , the U.S. should continue to hold Sudan accountable for its malign behavior and keep the nation listed as a state sponsor of terrorism , because Bashir \u2019 s regime destroys churches and persecutes the country \u2019 s Christian minority .\nAs Secretary Pompeo and other Trump administration officials work to hammer out a long-term agreement with North Korea , they should include measures to stop the North from proliferating weapons and nuclear technology to corrupt rogue regimes in Sudan and elsewhere .","bias":2}
{"id":"ONsmqdJNgFP8R1si","content":"Story highlights Liz Cheney , running for U.S. Senate , declared opposition to same-sex marriage\nCheney 's sister , who is in a same-sex marriage , says Liz is on the wrong side of history\nRuben Navarrette : Liz Cheney should recognize that same-sex marriage is about freedom\nHe says his brother , who is gay , persuaded him to change his view on marriage\nRepublicans portray themselves as the party of family values . Yet , in Wyoming , one prominent group of right wing kinfolk will spend the holidays embroiled in a family feud .\nYou do n't get to choose your family . Still , family members might choose a destructive lifestyle that puts them at odds with loved ones . They make others uncomfortable , and hurt those who love them . These people are often thinking only of themselves , and they have n't considered the consequences of their behavior .\nLiz Cheney is one of these people . And the destructive lifestyle she has chosen is that of a politician .\nThe Republican Senate candidate from Wyoming is running to the right of Republican incumbent Sen. Mike Enzi . And because that might not be so easy to do , whenever the challenger offers an opinion on a topic , it 's difficult to know if she 's speaking from the heart -- or pandering to the lowest common denominator .\nAn independent political group calling itself the American Principles Fund , which is defending Enzi , recently launched an ad attacking Cheney for opposing a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage and supporting the decision of the State Department to give benefits to same-sex partners of employees .\nThis week , while calling on Enzi to denounce the ad and labeling it `` gutter politics , '' Cheney stood by those earlier positions . During an interview on `` Fox News Sunday , '' she said :\n`` I do n't believe we ought to discriminate against people because of their sexual orientation . If people are in a same-sex relationship and they want their partner to be able to have health benefits or be designated as a beneficiary on their life insurance , there 's no reason we should n't do that . ''\nNonetheless , that ad puts Cheney in a tight spot , and given that Wyoming is a very conservative state and given that she 's trying to position herself on the far right of the spectrum , she ca n't be seen as soft on same-sex marriage .\nThus , in the same interview , she made clear that she does n't favor allowing same-sex couples to wed and that she supports `` the traditional definition of marriage . ''\nIt 's a position that Cheney has long held . That is part of the problem . In a country where , as public opinion polls make clear , the opinion of so many Americans on same-sex marriage is rapidly evolving due in large part to the fact that young Americans consider this a nonissue , it would have been good to see some personal growth from Cheney .\nBesides , she should tread lightly on this subject . Why ? Because blood is thicker than votes . And because Michael Corleone was right , and -- even in the rough and tumble of politics -- you `` do n't ever take sides with anyone against the family . ''\nAnd , for the Cheney family , this issue is personal . Liz 's sister , Mary , is in a same-sex marriage and has two children with her wife and longtime companion , Heather Poe .\n`` I love Mary very much . I love her family very much . This is just an issue in which we disagree , '' Cheney said on `` Fox News Sunday . ''\nMary Cheney was n't having any of it . Not long after the interview , she posted this rebuttal on Facebook :\n`` Liz -- this is n't just an issue on which we disagree -- you 're just wrong -- and on the wrong side of history . ''\nMary also shared a post by Poe , who was likewise bothered by Liz 's comments . It read :\n`` I was watching my sister-in-law on Fox News Sunday ( yes Liz , in fifteen states and the District of Columbia you are my sister-in-law ) and was very disappointed to hear her say ' I do believe in the traditional definition of marriage ....\n`` Liz has been a guest in our home , has spent time and shared holidays with our children , and when Mary and I got married in 2012 -- she did n't hesitate to tell us how happy she was for us .\n`` To have her now say she does n't support our right to marry is offensive to say the least . ''\nHere is what Liz Cheney missed : To many proponents of marriage equality , the very idea of `` traditional marriage '' is offensive . You see , tradition is the antithesis of progress . It was once tradition that women did n't have the right to vote , and African-Americans used separate restrooms , and U.S.-born Mexican-Americans were swept up in immigration sweeps . Those things had to change , and they did . In those instances , Americans decided that tradition should take a back seat to things like fairness , justice and equality .\nThis year , Christmas dinner at the Cheney house is bound to be awkward . The kids are fighting , and that sort of thing always hurts the parents most of all .\n`` This is an issue we have dealt with privately for many years , and we are pained to see it become public , '' Vice President Dick Cheney and his wife , Lynne , said Monday in a statement .\nThey insisted that Liz Cheney has `` always treated her sister and her sister 's family with love and respect , exactly as she should have done . '' And , they said , `` Compassion is called for , even when there is disagreement about such a fundamental matter . ''\nThe Cheneys know something about compassion . Over the years , they have been remarkably graceful and supportive toward Mary Cheney and her family . Dick Cheney has challenged conservatives in his own party by saying that gays and lesbians should be allowed to marry and that -- despite calls for a federal ban on same-sex marriage -- the issue should be handled at the state level .\nI know something about what Liz Cheney is going through . As recently as 14 years ago , I was opposed to same-sex marriage and supported the watered-down alternative : civil unions . I thought this was a battle that was n't worth fighting and that gay activists should focus their attention elsewhere .\nHowever , my younger brother , who is gay , would n't let me get away with it . He challenged me . He told me I was wrong . He forced me to be a better person . I changed my view , and came to understand that Americans ca n't have a two-tiered system , where some of us enjoy the right to marry the people we love while our brothers and sisters and cousins are denied that right , based on nothing more than sexual orientation . It 's discrimination with all its ugliness .\nIn the end , this is where we should arrive . Not just because you love your brother , or your sister , but because , just as importantly , you love your country . And you understand what America stands for above all else : freedom .","bias":0}

He also wished the Mueller report was finished .\nBack at the White House on Friday , the Republican president unleashed a series of tweets slamming Cohen and accusing him of lying .\n\u201c He was very unhappy that they were holding the hearings while he was overseas , \u201d said one person who was present and asked to remain unnamed . \u201c He was also very unhappy that the Mueller investigation had not been concluded before he left . He felt that there was a cloud hanging over him . \u201d\nWhile at the summit , Trump cut the talks about North Korea \u2019 s denuclearization short and the two sides gave conflicting accounts of what happened , raising doubts about the future of one of Trump \u2019 s signature initiatives .\nThe White House had included a signing ceremony for a deal on Trump \u2019 s public schedule in Hanoi - and then abruptly canceled it . Trump \u2019 s Secretary of State Mike Pompeo complained about reporters being obsessed with what he tried to dismiss as \u201c process \u201d and said they were \u201c radically uninformed . \u201d\n\u201c Y \u2019 all shouldn \u2019 t get hung up on things like that , \u201d Pompeo told reporters traveling with him .\nAs the summit unfolded , Trump kept up to date with Cohen \u2019 s testimony from his suite at a Hanoi hotel despite the 12-hour time difference .\nThe conclusion among Trump \u2019 s inner circle was that the president came out of the week okay , feeling there was not much new in Cohen \u2019 s testimony and that Trump was getting credit for walking away from a potentially bad deal with the North Koreans .\n\u201c There were no surprises this week , \u201d said Christopher Ruddy , a conservative media mogul and a close friend of the president . \u201c We knew North Korea was a tough nut to crack and that Michael Cohen was going to say a lot of nasty stuff . At the end of the day I don \u2019 t think it changes the political climate for President Trump , \u201d Ruddy told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nBut the Cohen testimony raised questions among Trump allies about the ability of Republicans and the president \u2019 s re-election campaign to organize a proper response .\n\u201c Where \u2019 s the defense of the president ? \u201d former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie , a Trump friend , told ABC \u2019 s \u201c This Week \u201d program on Wednesday .\nIn Congress , efforts to block Trump \u2019 s national emergency declaration intensified with the introduction of legislation in the Republican-led Senate , although it faces an uphill path to passage .\nTrump will have a friendly audience on Saturday when he addresses the annual meeting of the Conservative Political Action Conference in a Maryland suburb of Washington .\nAt CPAC on Thursday , Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel was quick to defend Trump \u2019 s handling of the Vietnam summit .\n\u201c He walked away rightly because he said we \u2019 re not going to take away the sanctions if you not going to de-nuclearize , \u201d she said to applause .","bias":1}
{"id":"V4S5LE3WqdOWfWj7","content":"After adding a robust 275,000 new jobs back in January , job growth appears to be slowing . The Labor Department reports that the economy added only 69,000 jobs in May .\nMeanwhile , despite the worst recession in generations , there are still countless small business owners plugging away around the country , seeking to expand and hire more employees .\n`` This year we hired two more technicians , and we hope to hire one more , '' says Srinivas Konanki , who employs 20 people at Pipette Calibration Services , a laboratory equipment company he owns with his wife .\nThe Konankis operate just outside Boston . Their company calibrates very precise lab tools called pipettes , which measure and dispense liquids .\nA pipette looks kind of like an oversized ballpoint pen , with a click button on the top . But instead of pushing out a pen tip , the button is used to dispense liquid \u2014 sort of like a fancy squirt gun .\n`` The difference here is that you are actually measuring what you 're squirting , '' Konanki says , rather than just indiscriminately shooting water . `` And so this [ measures ] very accurate volumes . ''\nKonanki is expert in the workings of pipettes . His wife , Manjula Konanki , jokes that he could talk about them for hours .\nBut get them talking about their business , and the Konankis take a more serious tone .\n`` We , as a small business , have been very careful as to how we spend our money , '' Srinivas says .\nFor any business , job growth has a lot to do with confidence . To hire new workers , an entrepreneur needs to be optimistic that business will keep picking up .\nThe economic environment has given business owners plenty of cause for caution . One thing troubling Srinivas is the ongoing economic turbulence in Europe . Many European countries run research labs in the Boston area , and `` when they make cuts , they make cuts all over , '' he says . `` And when that happens , we see our business cut down . ''\nHis other big concern is potential cutbacks in U.S. government spending , particularly potential cuts to the National Institutes of Health .\nThat 's because , at the end of the year , as part of what 's called `` sequestration , '' the NIH could be hit with an across-the-board 8 percent funding cut .\nSequestration will only happen if Congress is unable to hit budget-cutting targets it imposed on itself through legislation last year . But a failure to reach those targets would trigger dramatic broad-based cuts like those proposed for the NIH , among numerous government agencies .\n`` Even a couple of percentage points funding [ cuts ] to the NIH \u2014 it definitely makes a big difference to all the labs out here , '' Srinivas says . `` That will definitely affect our business . ''\nBetsey Stevenson , a labor economist with the University of Pennsylvania 's Wharton School of Business , says Srinivas ' concerns are very real .\nShe agrees that Europe could be creating a headwind on hiring in the U.S. and says many other businesses are worried about what actions Congress might take later this year as it decides whether or not to extend the Bush-era tax cuts and wrestles over unemployment benefits and required spending cuts .\nAll these decisions facing Congress at year 's end have been collectively dubbed the `` fiscal cliff . ''\n`` Congress is saying , 'We 're going to make this difficult , ' `` Stevenson says . That sends a signal to all the actors in the economy , she says , that `` there is potential for real damage to our economy coming in the future , and you should prepare for it today . ''\nDespite all these unanswered questions , the U.S. is still managing to add new jobs each month .\n`` We 've had slow growth , but it is growth , '' not losses , says David Kotok , chief economist at Cumberland Advisors , a Florida-based investment advisory firm .\nKotok acknowledges that job growth has slowed since the start of the year . But while he says that 's disappointing , he also sees reasons to be optimistic .\n`` The manufacturing sector is growing in the United States , '' Kotok says . As it does , he continues , it creates higher-paying jobs . The energy sector is also doing well , he says , with rapid growth in natural gas exploration promising to create many more well-paid work opportunities .\n`` And the third piece , '' Kotok says , `` is the gradual stabilization of housing . It 's happening slowly \u2014 but it 's happening . ''\nIf that trend continues , that eventually means more jobs for carpenters , electricians and many other people who work in related industries .\nKotok , the chief investment officer for a firm that manages billions of dollars , has to put his money where his mouth is when it comes to reading the economic tea leaves . And he says he 's placing his chips on a slow but continued recovery for the U.S. economy and for employment .","bias":1}
{"id":"DjDsmq6ld6uR5YkM","content":"Even for someone who \u2019 s shunned the public eye and spoken solely through indictments for the past year and a half , Robert Mueller has been uncharacteristically quiet in recent weeks . This is , of course , by design\u2014Justice Department guidelines stipulate that prosecutors should avoid taking any major steps close to elections . And unlike former F.B.I . director James Comey , those who \u2019 ve worked with Mueller expected him to hew closely to D.O.J . protocol . \u201c The one thing I am confident of is that he is going to make sure that he doesn \u2019 t do anything on the timing front that would interfere with the midterm elections , \u201d Glenn Kirschner , a former homicide prosecutor who reported to Mueller in the 1990s , told me last month . \u201c It wouldn \u2019 t surprise me if the indictment went completely radio silent between now and the midterms . \u201d\nThough it was preordained , Mueller \u2019 s silence has nevertheless raised expectations as to what he might deliver once ballots are cast . Citing two U.S. officials , Bloomberg reported early Wednesday that he is expected to issue reports on two critical aspects of the D.O.J . investigation into Russian interference shortly after midterm elections . Specifically , Mueller is expected to release his findings on whether Donald Trump obstructed justice , and if there was collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government , according to one official that spoke with the outlet . ( Trump and his campaign have denied any wrongdoing . )\nThis timeline raises several questions about the future of the Russia investigation . For one thing , it \u2019 s unclear whether such a report would mark the end of the inquiry . Per Bloomberg , Mueller is under pressure from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to wrap up his investigation as \u201c expeditiously as possible. \u201d But if a blue wave sweeps Democrats to a majority in the House , the political calculus for Rosenstein could change . The No . 2 Justice Department official , who took over the Russia probe after Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself last year , has come under frequent attacks from Trump and the president \u2019 s allies in the House . But such pressure would likely dissipate if Democrats won back the chamber .\nOf course , how long Rosenstein will remain in control of the probe is also an open question . For weeks , reports have circulated that Trump is likely to fire Sessions after the midterms\u2014rumors the president has made little effort to tamp down . Republican senators\u2014who were once largely united in their defense of their former colleague from Alabama\u2014have seemingly resigned themselves to the attorney general \u2019 s ouster . If Trump appoints someone to replace Sessions who manages to survive a Senate confirmation , that person could then take over from Rosenstein .\nRosenstein \u2019 s fate , too , is unknown . After The New York Times reported last month that Rosenstein suggested officials secretly record Trump and discussed a plan to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove the president from office , the deputy attorney general reportedly offered to resign from his post . Trump later said he would prefer if Rosenstein remained in his post , and the two have since appeared to mend ties . But speculation remains that Trump may fire Rosenstein after the midterms as well .\nWhat is clear is that one of the most consequential chapters in the Mueller investigation will follow the midterm elections . Between now and November 6 , Kirschner told me , the special counsel could issue \u201c satellite indictments \u201d for fringe players in the Russia saga , such as former Trump adviser and longtime Republican operative Roger Stone , but any bombshells will have to wait . By then , Trump could have very little to lose . With midterms in the rearview mirror , the stakes for both the president and the Republican Party could change dramatically . Trump , his businesses , and his administration are all but guaranteed to face heightened scrutiny if Democrats win back the House , but the G.O.P . is predicted to hold on to its majority in the Senate , meaning impeachment will likely remain a liberal pipe dream . Trump , meanwhile , will have newfound latitude to curtail the Russia investigation\u2014without the fear of repercussions at the ballot box .","bias":0}

{"id":"Xlc7jKffyBJi3NoX","content":"The Supreme Court on Monday ruled that a Louisiana law requiring that individuals who perform abortions at clinics have admitting privileges in a nearby hospital is unconstitutional , as it places an undue burden on women seeking abortions .\nThe court ruled 5-4 in the case , June Medical Services LLC v. Russo , with Chief Justice John Roberts once again casting a deciding vote by siding with the court 's liberal justices .\nSUPREME COURT SIDES WITH TEXAS GOP OFFICIALS OVER MAIL-IN BALLOTS , TRUMP CALLS IT A 'BIG WIN '\nThe opinion , written by Justice Stephen Breyer , noted that the Louisiana law is `` almost word-for-word identical '' to a Texas law the court ruled was unconstitutional in 2016 's Whole Woman \u2019 s Health v. Hellerstedt . A District Court had rejected the Louisiana law because of that precedent , but a court of appeals ruled otherwise .\n`` We have examined the extensive record carefully and conclude that it supports the District Court \u2019 s findings of fact , '' Breyer wrote . `` Those findings mirror those made in Whole Woman \u2019 s Health in every relevant respect and require the same result . We consequently hold that the Louisiana statute is unconstitutional . ''\nBreyer noted that the District Court found that the law \u201c offers no significant health benefit \u201d and that \u201c conditions on admitting privileges common to hospitals throughout the State have made and will continue to make it impossible for abortion providers to obtain conforming privileges for reasons that have nothing to do with the State \u2019 s asserted interests in promoting women \u2019 s health and safety . \u201d\nUltimately , the majority felt that this case was virtually the same as the 2016 case , and ruled accordingly .\n`` This case is similar to , nearly identical with , Whole Woman \u2019 s Health , '' Breyer wrote . `` And the law must consequently reach a similar conclusion . ''\nRoberts had dissented in the 2016 case and said in a concurring opinion that while he still believes that the past case was wrongly decided , he was ruling with the majority in the present case due to court precedent .\n`` The legal doctrine of stare decisis requires us , absent special circumstances , to treat like cases alike , '' Roberts wrote . `` The Louisiana law imposes a burden on access to abortion just as severe as that imposed by the Texas law , for the same reasons . Therefore Louisiana \u2019 s law can not stand under our precedents . ''\nIn dissent , Justice Clarence Thomas wrote , `` Today a majority of the Court perpetuates its ill-founded abortion jurisprudence by enjoining a perfectly legitimate state law and doing so without jurisdiction . ''\nThomas claimed that those performing abortions do not have standing to challenge laws on the basis that they restrict the ability to get an abortion , because it is not their rights that are at issue , but their potential patients ' .\nThomas went on to flatly state that `` abortion precedents are grievously wrong and should be overruled . ''\nROBERTS EMBRACES ROLE AS SUPREME COURT SWING JUSTICE , WITH LATEST CHURCH RULING\nJeanne Mancini , president of March for Life , said her organization was `` appalled '' by the Supreme Court 's decision .\n`` The legislation at issue in June Medical Services v. Russo was designed to safeguard women \u2019 s health and safety , which the abortion business in Louisiana egregiously sidelined for the sake of profit , '' Mancini said in a statement . `` No abortion facility should receive a free pass to provide substandard care . ''\nWhen the case was being argued in front of the Supreme Court , Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer , D-N.Y. , spoke at a rally hosted by the Center for Reproductive Rights in which he appeared to threaten Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh -- conservatives who were appointed by President Trump .\n`` I want to tell you , Gorsuch . I want to tell you , Kavanaugh . You have released the whirlwind and you will pay the price ! '' Schumer warned . `` You won \u2019 t know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions . ''\nGorsuch and Kavanaugh both opposed Monday 's decision , but with Roberts siding with the liberal justices , they had no effect on the outcome .\nAfter the court 's decision was handed down , Schumer tweeted an observation about how the court has been ruling as of late .\n`` The Supreme Court \u2019 s entering Buffalo Springfield territory : 'There \u2019 s something happening here , ' '' he wrote .\nThis is just the latest closely watched court case where Roberts has cast a critical vote , and angered conservatives .\nThe court recently ruled , in a 5-4 decision penned by Roberts , that President Trump 's reversal of former President Barack Obama \u2019 s DACA executive order \u2013\u00ad that shielded immigrants who came to the country illegally as children from deportation \u2013\u00ad was in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act ( APA ) , which sets out rulemaking procedures for federal agencies .\nIt was Roberts who , by siding with the liberal wing and reinterpreting an individual mandate as a tax , allowed ObamaCare to be found constitutional in 2012 . Last year , he joined with the wing again in shutting down Trump \u2019 s efforts to add a citizenship question to the census .\nMonday 's ruling , meanwhile , could impact legal and political efforts to roll back broader abortion rights .\nThe Louisiana statute is just one of dozens of new sweeping state-level abortion restrictions nationwide , which activists on both sides say could push the Supreme Court to revisit its nearly five-decade Roe v. Wade precedent that guarantees a women 's right to the medical procedure .\nIt also comes as abortion has once again become a major campaign issue .\nTrump in January became the first sitting president to address anti-abortion March for Life rally in person , telling activists `` I 'm fighting for you , and we 're fighting for those who have no voice , and we 'll win , because we know how to win .

President Francois Hollande described the most seriously injured as being `` between life and death . ''\nStaff at the Lenval Hospital in Nice said 28 children remained hospitalized .\nHollande , addressing his country following its third major terrorist attack in 18 months , described the assault as an `` unspeakable act '' and vowed that France would `` be able to overcome all trials . ''\n`` We have an enemy who is going to continue to strike all the people , all the countries who have freedom as a fundamental value , '' Hollande said .\nBouhlel was identified by fingerprints after his identification card was found in the truck , Molins said . Authorities began searching an apartment building where Bouhlel apparently lived , and Molins said Bouhlel 's ex-wife had been detained .\nNo group has claimed responsibility for the attack , and authorities did not release information about a motive . Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said that so far , the investigation has not uncovered any evidence of jihadism . But Molins said the attack fits with calls that `` terrorist organizations regularly give out on their videos and elsewhere . ''\nBouhlel was known to police because of allegations of threats , violence and thefts over the last six years , and he was given a suspended six-month prison sentence this year after being convicted of violence with a weapon , Molins said .\nBouhlel 's father , who lives in Tunisia , has revealed that his son showed signs of mental health issues -- having had multiple nervous breakdowns and volatile behavior , said CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank .\nThe man was `` entirely unknown by the intelligence services , whether nationally or locally , '' Molins said .\n`` He had never been the subject of any kind of file or indication of radicalization , '' Molins said .\nThe attack was launched on a popular street that would normally be packed with tourists and residents on a sunny afternoon in July .\nOn a normal day , the stunning beach here in # Nice would 've been packed .

At one point , he fired a gun several times at three police officers close to a hotel , the prosecutor explained said .\nOfficers gave chase for about 300 meters until they shot him , Molins said .\nThe truck was rented on Monday and was supposed to have been returned Wednesday , Molins said , without saying who rented it . Surveillance video shows that about two hours before the attack Thursday , Bouhlel rode a bicycle to pick up the truck east of the city , the prosecutor said .\nAfter Bouhlel was shot , police found a handgun and some ammunition in the truck 's cab , as well as a replica handgun , two replica assault rifles , a cell phone and various documents , Molins said .

{"id":"8wEB1tfe2d6pkNTk","content":"It depends on whom you ask . When attempting to diagnose the reasons that Congress has steadily grown more polarized since the 1970s \u2014 now at levels of dividedness that have n't been seen since the early years of the 20th century \u2014 there is no consensus among political scientists or pundits .\nGerrymandering , the maneuver by which political boundaries are redrawn to favor one party over another in elections , is a popular culprit . The radicalization of the contemporary Republican Party is another common explanation .\nBut one factor that 's far less commonly discussed in popular conversation is rooted much more deeply in our society : skyrocketing income inequality .\nThe growing gulf between the rich and the poor has been shown by academics to correlate with political polarization in the past , but it 's been enormously difficult to establish causal links between the two phenomena .\nBut a new study by professors at the University of Oregon , Princeton University and Georgetown University has made a compelling breakthrough on this front . Examining data from state legislatures across the country , the researchers found there 's a strong causal link between increasing income inequality and widening rifts between state political parties .\nThe study is specific to state-level data , but the phenomenon it highlights is of tremendous importance for understanding the ripple effects of economic inequality . It also means that an economy designed to serve the 1 % is poisoning the very institutions that are needed to reform it .\nThe study : Using newly available data on state legislatures and inequality , the study finds inequality on the state level has a number of effects on state politics .\nThe first map below shows the change in income inequality in the states between 1997 and 2012 , as described in the study . The second map shows the level of polarization in each state over the same time period . The shift is subtle , but as a state takes on a deeper hue of green , it also grows more polarized :\nUnequal Incomes , Ideology and Gridlock : How Rising Inequality Increases Political Polarization\nUnequal Incomes , Ideology and Gridlock : How Rising Inequality Increases Political Polarization\nWhat happens when a state grows more unequal ? The researchers found that higher inequality increases the probability that Republicans are elected into office . State legislatures move to the right as Republicans secure more seats . Many of the seats they pick up were once held by moderate Democrats , who become something of an endangered species in this climate .\nWhile there are more Republican legislators , the study did not find strong evidence that new members shift the party 's ideology to the right . However , the median ideology for Democrats , whose moderate ranks have been depleted , drifts leftward .\nIn short , inequality causes a rightward shift in statehouses , and Democrats dig their heels in ever more deeply as they lose power and become more desperate to institute liberal policies designed to combat inequality .\nSo why exactly is this happening ? It 's not easy to say .\nWhile the causal link is clear , the mechanisms that explain it are n't . But there are some hypotheses the authors are considering exploring in their future research .\n`` An influx of campaign funds going to politicians who are going to be more favorable to the wealthy when there 's an increase in inequality might be just enough to flip a district that once elected a moderate Democrat into one electing a Republican , '' John Voorheis , the lead author of the study , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nBut a change in the financing landscape is just one potential factor among many .\n`` There 's also the possibility that there could be a reaction by the electorate itself , '' Voorheis explained . `` Something about inequality causes people to become more right wing \u2014 and that could work through the media , potentially . ''\nWhat if people just tend to grow more skeptical of liberal policy when at least some of society seems to be faring very well ? Or , alternatively , do they grow more hostile to redistribution when they think those at the bottom will benefit from taxation on an already-struggling middle class ?\nThe takeaway : State legislatures are not the same as Congress , and some of the dynamics are different . There is , for example , evidence that Republicans have become more partisan and less compromising than Democrats in Congress .\nBut it seems highly likely the underlying factors related to inequality that are producing a bigger gap between the parties on the state level are producing them on a national level as well . It 's just extremely difficult to prove that with Congress , because , unlike with the states , which can be compared to each other to weed out confounding variables , there 's no control group to compare to Congress . For now , our understanding of the relationship between inequality and polarization on the national level will remain one of correlation .\nThe consequences of extreme inequality on the political process present a nefarious catch-22 : Politicians must work together to assemble the major coalitions needed to fight inequality , but it may be precisely because of inequality that they ca n't get their act together . As the chasm widens further , more and more ordinary Americans will be swallowed up by the absence of action .","bias":1}
{"id":"nom4U7wjbTjvRoRf","content":"They think he wasted money on everything from an iPad-sized video mailer to direct mail for donors in states that don \u2019 t yet matter . They think his attacks on Marco Rubio are doing more harm than good . And they worry that , at the end , all he will have accomplished is the destruction of the Bush family brand .\nThe big-money supporters fueling Jeb Bush \u2019 s super PAC have found their boogeyman : Mike Murphy , a sharp-witted , Twitter-obsessed veteran GOP ad man who runs Right to Rise .\nIf Bush \u2019 s campaign ends with anything other than the GOP nomination , blame is certain to be widespread . But that donors and GOP operatives are already sniping at Murphy before the first votes are cast demonstrates the depth of frustration and displeasure with the Bush-world loyalist .\n\u201c It looks like they \u2019 re blowing the whole thing up , like even if Jeb can \u2019 t win , they \u2019 re not going to let anyone else win either , \u201d said a Florida Bush backer and Right to Rise donor who worked on Bush \u2019 s gubernatorial campaigns and in his administration . \u201c You might as well light all of this money on fire . Most of all , they \u2019 re hurting the reputation of a really great man . \u201d\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 interviewed nearly two dozen Right to Rise donors and Bush supporters , and all blamed Murphy for a super PAC strategy that has failed to boost their struggling candidate . Multiple advisers to the Right to Rise super PAC concede privately that the $ 40 million spent on positive ads aimed at telling Bush \u2019 s story has yielded no tangible dividends .\nAmong the many and varied complaints , several Republicans close to the Bush campaign have questioned the PAC \u2019 s decision to let John Kasich own the airwaves in New Hampshire this fall , allowing the Ohio governor to get a foothold in a state where Bush must perform well to keep his White House bid alive . Others faulted Right to Rise for spending so much money on telling Bush \u2019 s story and not changing tactics immediately after Donald Trump entered the race and began stoking the groundswell of anti-establishment sentiment and defined Bush \u2014 lastingly \u2014 as \u201c low energy . \u201d\n\u201c At a time when so many voters are anti-establishment and angry at the government , the last thing you should say in all of your campaign ads is \u2018 I am a former governor with a great record of governing , \u2019 \u201d said Joe Culotta , a former Republican Party of Florida consultant who is supporting Rubio . \u201c Do n't get me wrong , I respect Gov . Bush and totally agree that he did great things in Florida . But to voters , that translates to \u2018 I have a lot of experience in being part of the establishment and the government that you all hate . \u2019 \u201d\nThese sour feelings about Murphy \u2019 s management of Right to Rise mark a dramatic turn for a group that came out of the gate in stunning fashion , raising a record $ 103 million last summer and setting a breakneck pace that many , a year ago , thought couldn \u2019 t be matched .\nThat initial success coincided with Murphy \u2019 s re-emergence on the national political scene after he had been semiretired from politics , living in California and sitting out the 2012 presidential election . Long close to Bush , it surprised some when he was selected to lead the super PAC instead of playing a direct role inside the campaign . But Murphy quickly wooed donors and set in motion the strategy that reflected the general Republican consensus that Bush would be the easy front-runner and likely Republican nominee .\nThat all changed , and quickly , when Trump announced his candidacy and Bush revealed his weaknesses on the campaign trail . The whisper campaign about Right to Rise burning through money with little to show for it began shortly after that .\nThis isn \u2019 t the first time Murphy \u2019 s campaign spending has been questioned . After success helping to run Arnold Schwarzenegger \u2019 s first bid for governor in California , Murphy was criticized for overspending on Meg Whitman \u2019 s failed gubernatorial run . In an unusual business arrangement , Whitman made a $ 1 million investment in Murphy \u2019 s production company just months before he began working for her campaign . She eventually spent $ 144 million of her own money on the failed campaign .\nVeteran California political operative Don Sipple , who brought Murphy onto the Schwarzenegger campaign , laughed when asked about Murphy \u2019 s involvement with high price-tag campaigns .\n\u201c Murphy was doing the Meg Whitman campaign so he knows how to spend money , \u201d Sipple said , noting that Right to Rise 's \u201c return on investment is seriously elusive . \u201d\n\u201c Whether it \u2019 s the Jeb campaign or the super PAC concept , all of that has been based on conventional wisdom and past political activities , which is not valid for 2016 , it seems , \u201d Sipple said of Murphy \u2019 s spending strategy at Right to Rise .\nRight to Rise spokesman Paul Lindsay defended Murphy and said the super PAC is sticking to its playbook . \u201c Mike is focused on the same thing everyone in our organization is focused on : supporting Jeb and getting him elected , \u201d Lindsay wrote in an email . \u201c Our metrics for that goal are votes and delegates . \u201d\nSo far , Right to Rise has spent $ 58.8 million , according to ad-tracking data from SMG Delta and reported by NBC News , and doesn \u2019 t have plans to drop off anytime soon . Seeing little return on the positive ads , the super PAC shifted recently to negative contrast spots to weaken the establishment candidates sitting ahead of Bush in the polls .\nBut that does not explain why the group sent mailers featuring a video player showing a 15-minute documentary to Bush supporters in New Hampshire , Iowa and to a select group of donors and finance prospects over the weekend . Right to Rise is expected to also send the mailer to some Republican leaders in South Carolina .\nWhile Right to Rise spokesman Lindsay dismissed criticism of the video mailer investment , saying the group sent 300 copies of the video mailer for just \u201c a few thousand dollars in total , \u201d it was part of a series of line-item expenditures that donors worry won \u2019 t help Bush .\nWeeks earlier , for example , Right to Rise purchased advertising space on billboards in a few early voting states featuring a Bush quote in white letters against a red background : \u201c Donald Trump is unhinged , \u201d it read . Rankled by what they saw as more wasteful spending , a handful of Bush supporters in Florida began emailing around a photoshopped image of the billboard but with a different quote : \u201c Light all the donor money on fire. \u201d It was attributed to Murphy .\nWhile Murphy \u2019 s critics have been vocal , the jury is out on whether some of his tactics and investments will ultimately prove successful . So far the super PAC \u2019 s spending has had almost no positive impact on Bush \u2019 s poll numbers , nationally or in the early voting states . Since Labor Day , Bush has not cracked 11 percent in any poll of New Hampshire Republican voters , according to HuffPollster \u2019 s tracker . Trump , Rubio , John Kasich , Ted Cruz and Ben Carson have all run ahead of him .\nBut on Wednesday , a new survey from CNN\/WMUR put Bush and Rubio even at 10 percent .\nAnd for its part , the Bush campaign thinks the ads have helped buoy their candidate .\n`` It is clear from the momentum we are seeing in the ground in the early states that ads echoing Jeb 's optimistic , conservative vision from the stump are having an impact and moving the needle in this race , '' said Kristy Campbell of the Bush campaign .\nYet without some dramatic improvement in Bush \u2019 s position , donors say Murphy \u2019 s strategy might be doing nothing more than harming Rubio at precisely the moment the GOP could be rallying around an alternative to Trump or Cruz . Those Right to Rise donors who know Bush personally also worry about Murphy \u2019 s slash and burn tactics affecting the former governor \u2019 s legacy .\n\u201c It \u2019 s painful , because we \u2019 re watching something happen that no one envisioned happening . We all wanted it to be Jeb , but if it can \u2019 t be Jeb , at some point , doesn \u2019 t reality have to set in ? \u201d one donor said .\nLindsay defended Right to Rise \u2019 s decision to go on the offensive against Bush \u2019 s rivals . \u201c The sequence of our strategy began with informing voters about Jeb \u2019 s successful record as governor of Florida , and it has shifted to comparing that record with those of his opponents , \u201d he said . \u201c We 're not distracted by anonymous critics from rival campaigns who are rattled because their candidates \u2019 records are being vetted . ''\nIn New Hampshire , where Bush \u2019 s campaign has consistently felt more optimistic about his prospects than the polling indicates it should , staffers have started to voice more pessimism about the super PAC under Murphy .\n\u201c He was supposed by the artillery and the cavalry , and instead he has just fired duds , \u201d said a Bush staffer .\n\u201c We haven \u2019 t seen the Jeb Bush we all grew up on , a hard-core conservative . That \u2019 s not who we saw on the campaign trail for the first few months until recently , \u201d another Republican said , summing up the mood of staff . \u201c To the extent that wasn \u2019 t happening until recently , I have to believe it wasn \u2019 t Jeb . That rhetoric was coming from Mike Murphy . \u201d\nFor its part , the Bush campaign and the super PAC have often used similar language . And one Bush aide said that it shouldn \u2019 t be surprising that the super PAC is engaging in attack ads to show a contrast with the other candidates .\nMurphy has long been a polarizing figure in Republican politics . After dropping out of college to focus on politics full-time , he was involved in a slew of political campaigns . He \u2019 s advised Republicans like John McCain , Rick Lazio , Tommy Thompson and Lamar Alexander .\nHe was a founder of DC Navigators before starting the political consulting firm Revolution Agency .\nHis involvement with Bush world goes back to President George H.W . Bush \u2019 s 1992 presidential bid , in which he served as an adviser before leaving the campaign . He also served as a consultant for Jeb Bush \u2019 s successful 1998 and 2002 gubernatorial races .\nEven Murphy \u2019 s friends concede that his personality can be an acquired taste .\nGOP lobbyist David Carmen , a friend for more than two decades , described Murphy as being the \u201c Bill Belichick of GOP politics , \u201d referring to the longtime head coach of the New England Patriots .\n\u201c And what I mean by that is [ Belichick ] is famous for his sort of taciturn behavior and the phrase \u2018 Do your job \u2019 , \u201d Carmen said . \u201c I think Mike feels that everyone should just do their job , and he spends all night every night , all day every day , thinking about every possible contingency and formulation about what might occur in a given campaign . \u201d\n\u201c That comes across to some people as off-putting , but that is who he is , \u201d Carmen said . \u201c He is a genius of the mechanics of politics . He \u2019 s always been that way . \u201d\nOne major difference \u2014 Belichick has won four Super Bowls and Murphy still hasn \u2019 t claimed a presidential campaign victory .","bias":0}

''\nObama 's comments were made to the backdrop of Colorado and Washington state legalizing and regulating marijuana . His remarks could be taken as another signal that his administration will not interfere with their experiment -- though recreational marijuana use remains illegal under federal law .\nThe president echoed the argument that pro-legalization advocates often make , stressing the cost to society of locking up minor drug offenders .\n`` Middle-class kids do n't get locked up for smoking pot , and poor kids do , '' Obama said . `` And African-American kids and Latino kids are more likely to be poor and less likely to have the resources and the support to avoid unduly harsh penalties . ''\nBut his administration , and those of his predecessors , repeatedly have documented and publicized health risks from the drug .\nObama 's own Office of National Drug Control Policy still states on its website that the administration `` steadfastly opposes legalization of marijuana and other drugs . ''\nThe office lists a range of negative health and mental consequences from the drug , including schizophrenia , lower IQ ( `` as much as an 8 point drop '' ) , and higher risk of heart attack .\nThe National Institute on Drug Abuse says the drug is addictive , with nearly 4.2 million people having a pot abuse or addiction problem in 2011 .\nThe agency says the drug is linked to `` school failure '' and high doses `` can cause psychosis or panic when you 're high .

{"id":"xTHY5X3rEiIqPg6z","content":"On Friday , one of Michael Flynn \u2019 s closest deputies on the National Security Council was denied clearance . | Getty CIA freezes out top Flynn aide The agency denied a security clearance for a key aide to the National Security Adviser \u2014 ratcheting up tensions between Flynn and the intel community .\nA top deputy to national security adviser Michael Flynn was rejected for a critical security clearance , effectively ending his tenure on the National Security Council and escalating tensions between Flynn and the intelligence community .\nThe move came as Flynn \u2019 s already tense relationships with others in the Trump administration and the intelligence community were growing more fraught after reports that Flynn had breached diplomatic protocols in his conversations with the Russian ambassador to the United States .\nOn Friday , one of Flynn \u2019 s closest deputies on the NSC , senior director for Africa Robin Townley , was informed that the Central Intelligence Agency had rejected his request for an elite security clearance required for service on the NSC , according to two people with direct knowledge of the situation .\nThat forced Townley , a former Marine intelligence officer who had long maintained a top secret-level security clearance , out of his NSC post , explained the sources , who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive personnel matters .\nOne of the sources said the rejection was approved by Mike Pompeo , President Donald Trump \u2019 s CIA director , and that it infuriated Flynn and his allies .\nBoth sources said the CIA did not offer much explanation for why Townley \u2019 s request for so-called \u201c Sensitive Compartmented Information \u201d clearance was rejected . But the sources said that Flynn and his allies believe it was motivated by Townley \u2019 s skepticism of the intelligence community \u2019 s techniques \u2014 sentiments shared by Flynn .\n\u201c They believe this is a hit job from inside the CIA on Flynn and the people close to him , \u201d said one source , who argued that some in the intelligence community feel threatened by Flynn and his allies . \u201c Townley believes that the CIA doesn \u2019 t run the world , '' the source said .\nSpokespeople for the NSC and the CIA declined to comment . Townley and the White House press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment .\nRep. Adam Schiff of California , the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee , dismissed as \u201c baloney \u201d any suggestion that the clearance was denied because the intelligence community was trying to brush back Flynn .\nTrump and Flynn \u201c see treachery everywhere they go , \u201d Schiff said , adding \u201c if a security clearance is denied , it \u2019 s for a reason. \u201d Intelligence agencies tend to be careful in rejecting security clearances because \u201c they know they \u2019 re going to have to justify it , '' Schiff concluded .\nOne person close to Trump said that , within the White House , Flynn is regarded by some as waging \u201c a jihad against the intelligence community. \u201d This person said Flynn is blamed by some people around Trump for trying to turn the new president against the intelligence community during the campaign and transition period , when Trump was openly skeptical about U.S. intelligence findings that Russia meddled in the election to try to help his campaign and damage that of his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton .\nFlynn \u2019 s own ties to Russia , a leading U.S. geopolitical foe , also have come under scrutiny .\nTrump \u2019 s critics cited Flynn \u2019 s paid speech in Russia and dinner with Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2015 as evidence of ties between the Kremlin and Trump \u2019 s inner circle .\nAnd the FBI has been looking into Flynn \u2019 s December communications with Russia 's ambassador to the U.S. , Sergey Kislyak .\nFlynn had maintained that those communications did not include discussion of U.S. sanctions levied against Russia for hacking into Democratic electronic communications during the 2016 presidential race .\nBut The Washington Post on Thursday reported that sanctions were in fact discussed , citing nine top current and former officials at multiple agencies .\nDemocrats on Friday seized on the report , calling for Flynn to be suspended and pleading with Republicans to investigate him . Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland , the top Democrat on the House oversight committee , said he had `` grave questions '' about Flynn 's honesty \u2014 and whether other White House officials were aware of his communications with Kislyak .\nInside the Trump administration , the ranks of Flynn \u2019 s critics seem to be growing \u2014 and becoming emboldened .\nA White House official said there had been concerns about Flynn 's calls to the Russian ambassador , which were n't known by all of Trump 's top advisers and aides . The official said Flynn is not particularly close to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson or Defense Secretary James Mattis .\nSomeone close to Trump said `` a lot of people are gunning for Flynn , but I think the president likes him . ''\n`` The president thinks he 's loyal and has expertise , '' this person said . `` Among others , there 's this perception he is wild , outside the box , not suited for the office . \u201d\nA senior Trump official played down the idea that Flynn may be in danger , saying he remained in contact with top Trump officials and Cabinet secretaries .\nTrump , in a Friday afternoon gaggle aboard Air Force One , said he was unaware of the report that Flynn had discussed the sanctions with the Russian ambassador but said he would `` look into that .

{"id":"52eZKvfVgwxQjwDN","content":"A judge late Wednesday signed off on the settlement between the IRS and hundreds of tea party groups , closing out the last major legal battle over what all sides now agree was unwarranted and illegal targeting for political purposes .\nThe IRS agreed to pay $ 3.5 million to groups that were wronged by the intrusive inspections , and insists it \u2019 s made changes so that political targeting can \u2019 t occur in the future .\nA few issues are still being fought over in the courts \u2014 including whether former IRS senior executive Lois G. Lerner will be allowed to forever shield her deposition explaining her behavior from public view , and whether the IRS should pay attorney fees \u2014 but this week \u2019 s decision closes out five years of litigation over the targeting itself .\n\u201c It shows that when a government agency desires to target citizens based on their viewpoints , a price will be paid , \u201d said Edward Greim , the lawyer who led the class action case in federal court in Cincinnati .\nThe $ 3.5 million closely approximates the fines the IRS would have had to pay in damages for each intrusive scrutiny of tea party groups , had the agency been found in violation of the law . The money will be split with half going to the lawyers who argued the case and the other half to more than 100 tea party groups , which will get a cut of about $ 17,000 each .\nJudge Michael R. Barrett called the settlement \u201c fair , reasonable and adequate . \u201d\nThe settlement doesn \u2019 t actually include an admission of wrongdoing by the IRS , though Mr. Greim and others said the payment is perhaps an even bigger mea culpa .\n\u201c I \u2019 m not frankly aware of any other class action lawsuit against the IRS for anything where the IRS paid money , \u201d Mark Meckler , who as president of Citizens for Self Governance funded the class action challenge , told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 when the settlement was submitted for final approval several weeks ago .\nEven with the settlement , however , Mr. Meckler told The Times that he still doesn \u2019 t think the IRS has improved and said he hasn \u2019 t seen any policy changes that would prevent a repeat .\n\u201c I \u2019 m a hundred percent certain it could happen again , \u201d he said .\nThe IRS vehemently disputes that , pointing to former Commissioner John Koskinen \u2019 s assurances to Congress that targeting is a thing of the past .\nThe IRS offered a \u201c sincere apology \u201d to tea party groups in a case filed in federal court in the District of Columbia and the government agreed to a declaratory judgment that \u201c it is wrong \u201d to scrutinize a tax return because of a taxpayer \u2019 s name or political philosophy .\nThe targeting began in 2010 and by the time it was exposed \u2014 first when Mr. Lerner planted a question at a conference , hoping to shape the news , then in an inspector general \u2019 s report , followed by congressional investigations and the court cases \u2014 it encompassed more than 400 groups .\nWhen they applied for tax-exempt status they were met with extensive delays and intrusive questions that the government admits never should have been asked . One group , the Albuquerque Tea Party , battled eight years before winning its status .\nMost of the groups targeted were conservative , but the IRS did start adding in liberal groups as it became aware of criticism .\n\u201c What we know is that this was not a mistake , and this was not an oversight or a lack of supervision , \u201d Mr. Greim said .\nDuring the class action lawsuit settled this week , the tea party groups pried loose thousands of pages of documents giving the best look yet at the decision-making within the IRS . Mr. Greim said emails clearly showed Ms. Lerner being aware of the targeting in 2011 and , rather than stopping it , relabeling it and telling the auditors to keep at it .\n\u201c She put in place new processes that guaranteed even more delay , \u201d he said .\nMs. Lerner has denied she encouraged the targeting , and a Justice Department review during the Obama administration not only cleared her , but called her one of the heroes of the saga , saying she tried to stop it .\nAfter invoking her Fifth Amendment right to remain silent before Congress , she was deposed in the class action lawsuit , along with deputy Holly Paz . But nearly all of their testimony remains under seal because the two women say they fear death threats if the public sees what they said .\nThey argue that since the case was settled , there \u2019 s no value to their testimony and it \u2019 s shouldn \u2019 t be part of the judicial record .\n\u201c Returning Mss . Lerner and Paz to the media spotlight places them at risk , regardless of what they actually said in those depositions . The only way to keep this litigation from putting them in the media spotlight is to completely seal the depositions and summary judgment materials quoting them , \u201d the women \u2019 s lawyers said in court filings .\nJudge Barrett has kept everything sealed for now , but is still weighing a final decision . He held a hearing Thursday on the matter .\nMs. Lerner \u2019 s lawyers told the judge she received another threat just last week , according to Mr. Greim . But the nature of the threats is also still under seal .\nThe Cincinnati Enquirer newspaper , the state of Ohio and Judicial Watch , a conservative legal group , have all asked for the testimony to be unsealed .\nMr. Greim said the Justice Department had signaled earlier that it , too , supported the move , seemed to have reversed itself in court on Thursday , when a federal lawyer said they have no position on the matter .","bias":2}

{"id":"0mA50GCyaw8TUa8k","content":"A new round of polls have confirmed a rapid tightening of the presidential race between frontrunners Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton .\nAfter trailing Clinton for months , two recent surveys \u2014 from Fox and Rasmussen \u2014 show Trump with a slight edge , +3 and +5 , over Clinton . A CBS\/New York Times poll taps Clinton with a 6-point lead , much narrower than the 10-point she enjoyed in that survey last month .\nA number of battleground state polls , also , have shown a very close race between Trump and Clinton . Trump leads in Arizona , Georgia and Ohio , while Clinton maintains narrow leads in Oregon and New Hampshire . Pennsylvania and Florida are toss-ups .\nPredictions of an inevitable Clinton landslide victory against Trump seem rather premature .\nObviously , the election is in November , not May , and the next few months can encompass several life-times in politics . Some of Trump \u2019 s strong performance in recent polling could be a function of him clinching the Republican nomination , while Clinton is still struggling against a tenacious primary challenger .\nRecent political stories have tracked Trump consolidating his victory at the same time that Bernie Sanders continues to win or at least competitively contest Democrat primaries against Clinton . Trump no longer has a significant number of his own party openly criticizing him , while Clinton is still dogged by sectarian fighting within the Democrat party .\nAlso , early polling is rarely predictive of the final election results . In May 2012 , Mitt Romney led Obama in several polls . In May 2008 , the race between McCain and Obama was a toss-up , with each holding narrow leads in some polls . John Kerry enjoyed broad polling leads in May and June 2004 , while George W. Bush held a 7-point lead over Gore in May 2000 .\nThe ups and downs of individual polls at particular points of time also obscures the new normal in Presidential politics ; the two parties are very evenly balanced across the country , generating very close contests . Three of the last five presidential elections have been decided by four points or fewer .\nEven the exceptions were relatively modest . President Obama defeated Sen. John McCain in 2008 by around seven points . Bill Clinton won reelection against Bob Dole by just over eight points . It is very likely that the 2016 election will be decided by fewer points than either of these two elections . American politics just doesn \u2019 t deliver large popular vote landslides for President anymore .\nWith the first party convention still more than 6 weeks away , the Presidential election is still very much in its preseason .\nSpeculation about a contested convention at the Republican gathering has evaporated , the spectre of drama at the Democrat convention in Philadelphia is increasing . Until those events are in the history books and the nominees are formally confirmed , the general election hasn \u2019 t yet begun .\nAll that said , there are four clear themes emerging from early polling that suggest Trump is in a stronger position for the general than many assumed would be the case . Although the general campaign is in its earliest days , these themes could easily solidify into a foundation for the election . If they do , Clinton would surprisingly find herself on the defensive throughout the campaign .\nClinton \u2019 s \u201c Historic \u201d Campaign Is a Dud . Hillary Clinton has left little doubt that her campaign will be based on the historic opportunity to elect the first woman President . The American political commentariat has long been obsessed with the \u201c gender gap , \u201d and if any candidate were poised to benefit from this phenomenon it ought to be Hillary . Yet , her lead over Trump , among women , is little better than that of a generic Democrat .\nIn the recent Fox poll , Clinton leads Trump by 12 points among women . In Rasmussen , she leads women by 11 points . She fares better in the CBS\/New York Times poll , leading Trump by 17 points among female voters . Among white women , however , Clinton trails Trump by 1 point .\nIn 2012 , Obama beat Romney by 11 points among women voters . In 2008 , Obama racked up a 13 point advantage over McCain among female voters . It almost goes without saying that neither Romney nor McCain had the unfavorable rating among female voters that plague Trump . In the Fox poll , 63 percent of women have a negative view of Trump .\nIn spite of this and , presumably , with the winds of history behind her candidacy , Clinton fares no better with women against Trump than Obama did against his two Republican rivals . Perhaps a sizable number of women would like to see a female President , but many seem to not want that person to be Hillary Clinton .\nTrump Is Benefiting From a Reverse Gender Gap . For all their talk about a \u201c gender gap , \u201d political pundits have rarely looked at the other side of the ledger . In fairness , while men have always had a slight Republican bias , it didn \u2019 t seem to break as clearly as the way the women \u2019 s vote has , or at least appears to . Based on early polling , however , the 2016 election may be one were the \u201c male gap \u201d has a profound impact on the election .\nIn the Fox and Rasmussen polls , Trump leads Clinton by 22 points among male voters , nearly double her advantage among women . The CBS poll shows his lead among men at just five points , but his lead among white men is 22 points .\nObama lost men to Romney by just seven points . In 2008 , Obama edged McCain among men by one point . If Clinton loses men by double-digits , her White House dreams will likely collapse again . Trump , in particular , has run very strongly among male voters throughout the Republican primary .\nClinton Cancels Out Trump \u2019 s Biggest Negatives . One could make several arguments for why Trump doesn \u2019 t make a strong general election candidate . In many cases , though , the marks against him are mitigated by blights on Clinton \u2019 s own record . Hillary is perhaps unable to fully exploit Trump \u2019 s bad numbers with female voters because of Bill Clinton \u2019 s unique problems with women . An entire generation of young female voters , who are critical to any Democrat election campaign , are only now learning about Bill \u2019 s very checkered past with females . The sensibilities of these young voters today is dramatically different than the views of female voters in the 1990s .\nThe Fox poll illustrates a deeper problem for Clinton , however . The poll surveyed voters about particular candidate \u201c characteristics , \u201d which have proven pivotal in how voters select a candidate . Trump scores poorly on many of these , but Clinton fares just as poorly or worse . Only 42 percent of voters think Trump \u201c cares about people like me , \u201d but only 46 percent believe the same of Clinton . A strong 65 percent of voters think Trump will \u201c say anything to get elected , \u201d but 71 percent believe that about Clinton . Just 37 percent believe Trump has \u201c strong moral values , \u201d but a similar 40 percent believe that about Clinton .\nA strong majority , 56 percent , believe Trump is running for President to benefit himself , but even more , 57 percent believe Hillary is simply running to benefit herself . Moreover , voters say Hillary is more corrupt than Trump by a 12 point margin . Another characteristic where Trump enjoys a strong advantage over Clinton is on being a \u201c strong leader. \u201d A solid 59 percent of voters say trait describes Trump , but only 49 percent say the same about Clinton .\nThe \u201c characteristics \u201d that might normally hurt Trump aren \u2019 t , simply because Clinton ranks no better with voters on these qualities .\nClinton Has a Likeability Problem . Every pundit will quickly point to Trump \u2019 s unfavorable numbers to justify their prediction of a Clinton landslide . Trump \u2019 s numbers are indeed bad on many of these measures , although there is some recent evidence that his ratings have inched higher since the end of a divisive primary . In any case , Hillary Clinton \u2019 s unfavorable numbers are equally bad .\nIn the Fox poll , Clinton \u2019 s favorable rating is only 37 percent , four points lower than Trump \u2019 s . Her unfavorablity is 61 percent , 5 points worse than Trump \u2019 s . Among Independents , 74 percent have a negative view of Clinton , 17 points worse than Trump . Among men , her unfavorablity is a jaw-dropping 71 percent . Ex-wives have higher favorable numbers than Clinton .\nEven in the Democrat-leaning PPP poll , Clinton \u2019 s unfavorable rating is 55 percent , just a few points better than Trump . Her net-rating ( favorable minus unfavorable ) among women is -14 and among men is -25 .\nTrump may have bad personal polling numbers , but Clinton \u2019 s are equally bad or worse .\nCampaigns will wax and wane between now and November . Outside events and the inevitable controversies will nudge the numbers a few points on either side . If history is any guide , the 2016 election will be very close in the end . Elections , however , do slip into general contours based on the individual candidates .\nThe four themes evident in early polling may define the broad parameters of the general election . If they do , then Trump has secured a solid early lead position in the race for the White House . It doesn \u2019 t look now like the election many predicted . But , then , nothing so far has proceeded as anyone predicted .","bias":2}
{"id":"xDz0SWM8VVpxn3Lz","content":"New York ( CNN ) Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders will face off in CNN 's Democratic presidential debate in Brooklyn Thursday night as they spar ahead of a critical contest in New York -- a state where both candidates have deep roots .\nThe April 19 primary here will come as Clinton -- whose campaign has been dogged by Sanders ' unexpected endurance -- is on an urgent mission to widen her delegate lead and lock up her party 's nomination .\nNext week 's contest will serve as one of Sanders ' last opportunities to change the dynamics of the Democratic race . And in turn , it will offer Clinton a crucial opening to once and for all shake the pervasive narrative that her rival -- even as he lags behind in the delegate count -- continues to enjoy real momentum ; tens of thousands of Sanders supporters rallied in Washington Square Park in Manhattan Wednesday night .\nIn a sign of the mounting pressure for both candidates , over the past few weeks , their exchanges on the campaign trail have grown increasingly bitter . Sanders has publicly questioned Clinton 's judgment and credibility , while Clinton has hit back by accusing her rival of being inexperienced and promoting an unrealistic platform .\nNext week 's contest will also be an especially personal one for both Democratic hopefuls .\nClinton , who served as the state 's senator for eight years , currently has a home in Chappaqua and chose to base her campaign headquarters in Brooklyn . Sanders , meanwhile , was born and raised in Brooklyn and still has a thick New York accent .\nBoth candidates are also insistent that they are best equipped to take on Republican front-runner Donald Trump -- another New Yorker .\nOver the past few weeks , Clinton and Sanders have ramped up their attacks , hitting each other harder on both character and policy . The new tenor of the race is in stark contrast to the earliest stages of the race , when the two candidates were cordial and made painstaking efforts to avoid going after each other .\nSanders , in particular , prided himself in running a positive campaign , constantly reminding voters that he had never run a negative ad in his political career .\nBut with the Democratic race dragging on into the spring , fresh tensions are bubbling up to the surface .\nPointing to issues like Clinton 's ties to Wall Street and her vote for the Iraq War , Sanders said over the weekend that when it comes to Clinton 's judgment , `` something is clearly lacking . '' The senator also went on to tell CNN 's Jake Tapper that he found Clinton 's recent remarks about young voters -- in which she said they sometimes buy into incorrect information and `` do n't do their own research '' -- to be `` a little bit condescending . ''\nThings grew even more heated when the Sanders campaign put out a press release questioning Clinton 's credibility this week -- an attack that was met with ferocious pushback .\n`` Let 's be very clear . This is a character attack . This is exactly what @ BernieSanders pledged to his supporters that he would n't do , `` tweeted Nick Merrill , Clinton 's traveling press secretary .\nLet 's be very clear . This is a character attack . This is exactly what @ BernieSanders pledged to his supporters that he would n't do . \u2014 Nick Merrill ( @ NickMerrill ) April 12 , 2016\nFor each , Tuesday 's contest is something of a homecoming . And with 247 delegates at stake , the stakes are higher than ever . Clinton is expected to come out on top , but with momentum at his back after winning six out of the last seven contests , Sanders believes New York could provide a chance for him to prove that he can stay in the race .\n`` I am enormously proud to be the senator from Vermont , but I have not forgotten where I was born and that is Brooklyn , '' Sanders told a crowd in Brooklyn last week . `` I think we have the campaign that has the momentum . ... And , with your help , we will win New York . ''\nA Sanders victory here would be a huge psychological blow toun the Clinton campaign , which has posited that the state is solidly her territory . Sanders ' advisers are basing their strategy on convincing superdelegates that he can overtake Clinton over time , and victory here would help him make his case . However , with Clinton 's lead in pledged delegates , her team knows that Sanders not only needs to win at least 56 percent of the remaining delegates to catch up .\nThursday 's debate will be the largest platform yet for Clinton and Sanders to make their case to a state that could be pivotal in the race . Look for both of them to make major appeals to Democratic voters here based on their personal backgrounds .\nJust across the river from the site of Thursday 's CNN debate looms something that has engulfed the 2016 Democratic race : Wall Street .\nVowing to break up the big banks and railing against the outsized role of Wall Street in the American political system are at the core of Sanders ' campaign . His unlikely bid for president has attracted a massive following in large part because of his populist message and promises to help poor and lower-income families .\nBut the fight between Clinton and Sanders over Wall Street has not only unfolded over policy disagreements .\nSanders has consistently used the financial industry to paint Clinton as an establishment insider in the pocket of special interests . He has slammed the former secretary of state for accepting donations from financial institutions , suggesting that she is beholden to big-money interests .\nOne major Wall Street bank has found itself in the middle of this flashpoint : Goldman Sachs .\nAt issue are three speeches Clinton made to Goldman Sachs , for which she was paid $ 675,000 . Sanders has repeatedly called on Clinton to release the transcripts from those speeches , saying the public has a right to know what she said in those private settings .\nClinton said she would only do so if all of her rivals running for president are also held to the same standards .\nRecently , Clinton has found a fresh line of attack against Sanders on the issue of Wall Street .\nAsked whether she thinks her connections to Wall Street will play a more central role in the debate now that the race has come to New York , Clinton told reporters this week : Bring it on .\n`` Let it happen . I have a record . As your senator , I spoke out . I called for changes . I have the best policy toward dealing with what needs to happen to prevent Wall Street from ever wrecking Main Street again , '' she said . `` Sen. Sanders could n't even answer questions about whatever his plan is so we 'll talk . ''\nIn an extensive interview with the New York Daily News , Sanders struggled to answer in detail questions about financial reform -- one of the pillars of his campaign . Clinton seized on the interview to raise questions about Sanders ' readiness to be president .\n`` Really , what that goes to is for voters to ask themselves can he deliver what he 's talking about , '' she said\nPresident Barack Obama made a candid admission over the weekend : his administration was n't adequately prepared to handle the fall of Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi .\n`` Probably failing to plan for the day after what I think was the right thing to do in intervening in Libya , '' Obama said in a Fox News interview when asked about the biggest mistake of his presidency .\nThe United States helped oust Gadhafi in 2011 . As secretary of state , Clinton was a major actor in those efforts and as a presidential candidate has remained a defender of U.S actions in Libya . But her tenure at the State Department has been a significant vulnerability for Clinton : Republicans and critics have persistently criticized her handling of the 2012 attacks at a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi , which killed U.S . Ambassador Christopher Stevens .\nSanders , for his part , has more broadly targeted Clinton 's views on regime change . This tension could resurface Thursday night if Clinton chooses to defend Obama administration 's engagement in Libya .\nA key fight between Sanders and Clinton spilled out into the open with the recent release of a video showing Clinton angrily responding to a climate activist who accused her of accepting `` fossil fuel money '' while the candidate shook hands with supporters after an event .\nWhen the activist , who is affiliated with environmentalist groups Greenpeace and 350 Action , asked if Clinton would `` reject '' funds from those industries , Clinton responded that she did not accept money directly from fossil fuel companies\u2014an action that is illegal anyway , since corporations ca n't directly contribute to political campaigns\u2014but that she did take money from individual donors who work in those industries . `` I 'm so sick of the Sanders ' campaign lying about me . I 'm sick of it , '' Clinton said .\nIn truth , oil and gas industry employees have donated to both Clinton and Sanders . Clinton has received more than $ 300,000 ; Sanders about $ 50,000 .\nBut Sanders has not backed down from the attack line , and his campaign has pointed to `` lobbyists and bundlers for the industry '' who have donated to Clinton and donations to super PACs supporting Clinton .\n`` Secretary Clinton owes us an apology . We were not lying . We were telling the truth , '' Sanders said during a rally on April 1 in Sheboygan , Wisconsin .\nAlthough the candidates and their surrogates have answered questions about the issue since Clinton 's altercation with the climate activist , Thursday 's debate could be the first time they address it with one another directly in public . If Sanders confronts Clinton on it , it could be an opportunity for Clinton to try to put the attack to rest before a large audience .","bias":0}
{"id":"YW5ntvLw0DbVi0AM","content":"Last weekend , the president got bored and decided to see if he could make Democrats defend one of the most dangerous , mismanaged places in the country . And of course , he could . It was n't hard . He just sent a flurry of tweets criticizing the city of Baltimore and Rep. Elijah Cummings . President Donald Trump called Baltimore a `` disgusting , rat and rodent invested '' hellhole , a `` corrupt mess '' that `` no human being '' would want to live in . A lot of people who 've never been to Baltimore claimed to be deeply offended by those remarks . One person who seemed to agree with them was former Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh . Just last year , she said things were so bad you could `` smell the rotting rats . ''\nThe mayor did not explain why she had n't cleaned things up . That footage of her remarks got almost no attention when it ran on a local news station . Neither did the recent story about Baltimore 's deputy policy commissioner getting robbed at gunpoint by four thugs while out to dinner with his wife . People were n't talking about that over dinner in Georgetown this weekend . If there 's one thing virtually everyone in Washington aggressively does n't care about , it 's Baltimore . It 's 40 miles and an entire world away . You could live your whole life in D.C. and never visit or think about Baltimore .\nThen , last weekend , orange Mussolini weighed in on the subject , and suddenly Baltimore became holy ground , a sacred city of light that only an infidel would disparage -- an infidel or , perhaps -- and this will not surprise you -- a racist . Because honestly , only a hardened bigot would criticize a place as awesome as Baltimore . That was the media consensus over the weekend .\nRepublicans still get red in the face when CNN calls them racist , but they should n't . The whole thing is a campaign tactic , dreamed up by the Democratic National Committee . Once the Russia conspiracy imploded , Democrats and their lackeys in the media moved to the only other message they have : `` Shut up , racist . '' It did n't work in 2016 for Hillary Clinton , but they 're hopeful it will this time . We 'll see .\nMeanwhile , Baltimore -- the actual city , not the metaphor -- could desperately use some attention . If anything , Trump 's tweets underplayed the crisis . Last year , the city recorded 309 homicides , a rate of more than 50 per 100,000 people . If Baltimore were a country , it would have the fourth-highest murder rate in the world , barely below Venezuela .\nOr think of it this way : Last week , the left denounced Trump for reaching a deal with Guatemala that declares the country a `` safe '' location for asylum seekers . Guatemala , they said , has too much crime and too many gangs to be considered safe ; making people stay there is a human rights violation . And yet , Baltimore 's murder rate is double that of Guatemala . In almost any way a city can be a disaster , Baltimore qualifies . More than 22 % of the city lives in poverty . Almost 65 % of children grow up in single-parent households . The schools are a catastrophe . In 2017 , one-third of Baltimore 's high schools had zero students proficient in math . That 's right . In 13 of Baltimore 's 39 high schools , not a single student -- not one -- was proficient in math . You 'd think that would be a national scandal . Bernie Sanders visited Baltimore a few years ago , and to his credit , he was shocked : `` Anyone who took the walk that we took around this neighborhood would not think you 're in a wealthy nation . You would think that you were in a Third World country . ''\nLooks like Bernie must be a white supremacist . Actually , he 's just an old-fashioned liberal . That 's how Democrats used to think ; if they saw misery and urban decay , they wanted to fix it . Modern progressives are different . Progressivism is n't about helping the people beneath you ; it 's about establishing your moral superiority . Democrats support the status quo in Baltimore . It does n't bother them . That 's not surprising . They created modern Baltimore . The city has n't had a Republican mayor in more than 50 years . Things really began to fall apart after the 2015 riots . The Obama administration imposed a consent decree on the city 's police department that radically restricted its ability to protect citizens . Not surprisingly , crime exploded . Cummings , by the way , praised that consent decree . He 's very much part of the problem . From her taxpayer-funded vacation in Italy , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended Cummings -- and Baltimore . Pelosi grew up in the city . Her father and her brother were mayors of Baltimore . But like most rich progressives , Pelosi herself is long gone . She 's got a winery in Napa now . She 's not interested in going back to Baltimore . Like most Democrats , she finds it easier to just lecture other people about it .\nTucker Carlson and Neil Patel co-founded The Daily Caller , one of America 's fastest growing online news outlets , which regularly breaks news and distributes it to over 15 million monthly readers .","bias":2}
{"id":"BDn3IlTe4NgO7is7","content":"Editors Barred A Black Reporter From Covering Protests . Then Her Newsroom Rebelled\nThe fight over racial justice that has sparked protests across the country is also upending some of the country 's leading newsrooms .\nAt The New York Times , James Bennet stepped down Sunday as editorial page editor , yielding to colleagues who had protested the posting of a column by Sen. Tom Cotton , R-Ark. , in which he advocated that the military help quell civil unrest .\nThe day before , The Philadelphia Inquirer Executive Editor Stan Wischnowski resigned . Controversy had erupted both in and outside his newsroom when the paper published the headline `` Buildings Matter , Too '' atop a column on rioting . Reporters there argued it equated property damage to human life .\nAnd at the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette , rank-and-file journalists are fighting back after editors banned a black reporter from covering local protests . It was retribution for writing a flippant tweet comparing looters to country music fans after a concert .\nNPR has learned that a white reporter at the paper who had tweeted a vulgar disparagement of a man accused of looting also received a warning on the same day as his black colleague . But the white reporter kept covering issues related to the protest . He was banned from covering protests two days later , only after the newspaper 's union raised the issue of disparate treatment .\nPost-Gazette Managing Editor Karen Kane and Executive Editor Keith Burris did not respond to detailed requests for comment .\nThe Post-Gazette newsroom has a tense relationship with its owners . Staffers have worked without a union contract for more than three years . Post-Gazette journalists have previously objected to the firing of liberal editorial cartoonist Rob Rogers over several cartoons , including ones satirizing President Trump . Co-owner John Block , who is the paper 's publisher and is also listed as editor-in-chief , had his photo taken in 2016 with Trump aboard the candidate 's private jet during the height of the campaign season . Burris was also on the plane , according to contemporaneous accounts .\nIn this case , Alexis Johnson remembers coming into the newsroom one week ago full of story ideas about the protests . She is 27 , African American and a Pittsburgh native .\n`` These are very much my friends and family and community members that were out there in the streets , protesting against police brutality in the black community , '' she told NPR .\nEditors did not respond to her pitches . Instead , she says , she was called by the paper 's managing editor and two other top editors . They pointed to a tweet she had sent out the previous night .\n`` Horrifying scenes and aftermath from selfish LOOTERS who do n't care about this city ! ! ! ! ! '' she wrote . `` .... oh wait sorry . No , these are pictures from a Kenny Chesney concert tailgate . Whoops . ''\nThe pictures showed the debris-strewn aftermath of Chesney 's concert at Pittsburgh 's Heinz Field .\n`` It 's almost a running joke in Pittsburgh , '' Johnson said . `` It 's infamous \u2014 what happens after these Kenny Chesney concerts when he comes into town . ''\nJohnson said she asked the editors to describe the bias they said she had shown .\n`` They kept doubling down , saying I gave my opinion through the tweet and that my opinion came through in the tweet , '' Johnson said . `` And I do n't think that 's the case at all . I think people made their own opinions of what I was trying to say . I thought it was kind of clever . ''\nThe paper barred Johnson \u2014 the daughter of a state trooper and a probation officer \u2014 from covering a story in her hometown about police and racial justice . Editors subsequently sidelined a black photographer , Michael Santiago , as well . The two are among a small number of black journalists at the paper . Of the 140 members of the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh , 13 are African American .\nColleagues took to social media to denounce the newspaper 's moves and to rally support for Johnson and Santiago . Scores retweeted Johnson 's original remarks . Since then , the paper has removed links to stories about racial justice written by several reporters who have voiced support for the two , according to the union .\nThe controversy lays bare the tension between a pursuit of impartiality that has been a journalistic tenet for three quarters of a century and a new urgency , felt keenly among younger journalists and journalists of color , to bear witness to what they 're seeing .\nTwo years ago , as editorial page editor , Burris wrote an editorial arguing that Trump 's remarks should never be characterized as racist , even , he wrote , after describing African nations as `` shithole countries . '' It sparked an outcry , including from some of Block 's relatives and shareholders in the paper 's parent company .\nNow one of Burris ' reporters , Johnson , says she believes her editors discriminated against her because of her race . And the gentler rebuke meted out to a white colleague for a related transgression appears to buttress her case .\nLike Johnson , digital sports reporter Joshua Axelrod is in his late 20s \u2014 28 to be exact \u2014 and less than a year into his job .\nA week ago , Axelrod reported on a man accused of vandalizing and looting stores in downtown Pittsburgh . He tweeted about it , calling the suspect a vulgar slang word .\n`` Not a very sound journalistic decision , admittedly , '' he told NPR in his first public comments on his actions and how the paper handled it .\n`` It felt like the nation and my city were undergoing a very tough time , and it was tough to separate myself as a journalist and just a person in the world , '' he said . `` And I recognize the mistake I made . But it came from a place of emotions running high . ''\nHis editors reprimanded him \u2014 on the same day that Johnson received her editors ' calls . Axelrod subsequently deleted the tweet .\nUnlike Johnson , however , Axelrod says he did not receive a directive preventing him from covering stories involving the protests . Indeed , he says he asked whether he was being punished and was told he was not . Axelrod posted an article related to the protests the next day .\nThe Newspaper Guild soon weighed in , noting that Johnson had been treated more severely than Axelrod . Faced with the seeming contradiction , the paper did n't relent against Johnson . Instead , the Post-Gazette banned Axelrod from protest coverage , too .\n`` I made a legitimate journalistic mistake , '' Axelrod says . `` I do not think either of them did . ''\nIn a press conference Monday , the union denounced the newspaper for what it contended was racial bias and called for advertisers to pressure the Post-Gazette to reverse its decisions .\nIn a series of tweets , Post-Gazette reporter Andrew Goldstein noted he had been encouraged to cover the mass killings at the Tree of Life synagogue in 2018 despite his own ties to the event : He is Jewish and lives near the synagogue . Further , he argued that the paper 's black journalists propel its knowledge of its communities .\n`` Diversity brings strength to newsrooms , '' Goldstein wrote . `` I 've seen it in action . ''\nGoldstein , like Santiago , was part of the paper 's large team honored with a Pulitzer Prize for the coverage of that massacre .","bias":1}

Davis went on to conduct a successful private practice in public relations and crisis communications , including publishing several books on how to publicly respond to a crisis . He is now executive vice president of Levick , a PR\/communications firm .\nTripp was a friend of Lewinsky 's who secretly tape-recorded telephone conversations in which the two women discussed Lewinsky 's affair with Clinton .\nTripp ultimately turned the tapes over to independent counsel Kenneth Starr and revealed to him the existence of Lewinsky 's blue dress stained with the president 's semen . In 2003 , the Defense Department paid Tripp more than $ 500,000 to settle a lawsuit she brought alleging that the department leaked personal information about her to the press . Tripp has since avoided publicity ; she has married and now runs a Christmas shop in Middleburg , Va .\nStarr , a former federal judge and U.S. solicitor general , was the independent counsel who led the investigation of the affair between Clinton and Lewinsky , eventually filing `` The Starr Report . '' He is now the president and chancellor of Baylor University in Waco , Texas , after spending some time in private practice and teaching law .\nHyde , a Republican congressman from Illinois , was chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , the panel charged with recommending action on impeachment . During the impeachment hearings , it was revealed that Hyde had an extramarital affair in the 1960s . Hyde retired from Congress in 2006 and died the next year at age 83 .\nGinsburg , a malpractice attorney and friend of Lewinsky 's father , represented Lewinsky for several months during the scandal .\nHe had previously been involved in cases involving the deaths of Liberace and college basketball player Hank Gathers . Ginsburg died of cancer in 2013 at age 70 .\nJordan , an attorney and civil rights activist , was a longtime friend and adviser to Clinton . Jordan helped try to find Lewinsky a private-sector job after she left a position at the Pentagon . During testimony before a grand jury , Jordan said he was assured by Lewinsky that she had not had a sexual relationship with Clinton and denied that he ever encouraged her to lie .\nJordan remained active in Democratic Party politics after Clinton left office . He also became a senior managing director of Lazard Freres & Company .\nThe infamous blue Gap dress , worn by Lewinsky during a sexual encounter with Clinton , was turned over to Starr 's team in 1998 during the investigation .

Education is no defense . Like his famous father , Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has a Harvard pedigree and a law degree from the University of Virginia , with a stint at the London School of Economics in between . None of that was a match for the magnetic pull of the anti-vaccine delusion .\nAre we inherently gullible ? Research says no : Most adults have well-functioning machinery for detecting baloney , but there \u2019 s a common bug in the machine .

Not when the creator of Sherlock Holmes believes in fairies and gnomes . A coronavirus conspiracy is mild B.S . compared with the great conspiracy theory of 2016 , the weapons-grade hooey known as # Pizzagate . In that viral sensation , important political figures supposedly ran a child-abuse ring out of the basement of a pizzeria that , by the way , doesn \u2019 t have a basement .\nPeople believe in a \u201c # Plandemic \u201d because it fits into existing convictions .

As the turkey was carved , they shared thoughts of their families .\n`` I wish I could be home with my family and friends , but , I mean , I am surrounded by nothing but awesome people , so it is good , '' U.S. soldier Vanessa Gann said .\nIn Kabul , soldiers and service members with the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) sang carols and lit candles during a service on Christmas Eve at the U.S.-led coalition base .\nFor some soldiers , this is hardly the first Christmas away from home . But it should be one of the last in Kabul , with NATO forces expected to mostly withdraw by 2014 . The U.S. and allied nations are trying to turn over the country to Afghan-led security forces .\nMore On This ... Holiday revelers celebrate Christmas around the world\nAs troops rung in the holiday , and soon the new year , Christians from around the world flocked to Manger Square in Bethlehem on Tuesday to celebrate the birth of Jesus in the ancient West Bank town where he was born .\nOthers traveled to Vatican City , where Pope Benedict XVI delivered his traditional `` Urbi et Orbi '' speech -- Latin for `` to the city and the world '' -- from the central balcony of St. Peter 's Basilica to thousands of pilgrims , tourists and Romans gathered in the piazza below .\nBenedict wished Christmas peace to the world , decrying the slaughter of the `` defenseless '' in Syria and urging Israelis and Palestinians to find the courage to negotiate .\nHe also encouraged Arab spring nations , especially Egypt , to build just and respectful societies and prayed that China 's new leaders respect religion , a reference to persecution Chinese Roman Catholics have at times endured under communism .\nOvercast skies and a cold wind did n't dampen the spirits of worshippers who came dressed in holiday finery and the traditional attire of foreign lands to mark the holy day in this biblical West Bank town . Bells pealed and long lines formed inside the fourth-century Church of the Nativity complex as Christian faithful waited eagerly to see the grotto that is Jesus ' traditional birthplace .\nThe cavernous church was unable to hold all the worshippers who had hoped to celebrate Christmas Day Mass inside . A loudspeaker outside the church broadcast the service to the hundreds in the square who could not pack inside .\nTourists in the square posed for pictures as vendors hawked olive wood rosaries , nativity scenes , corn on the cob , roasted nuts , tea and coffee .\nAn official from the Palestinian tourism ministry predicted 10,000 foreigners would visit Bethlehem on Christmas Day and said 15,000 visited on Christmas Eve -- up 20 percent from a year earlier . The official , Rula Maia ' a , attributed the rise in part to the Church of the Nativity 's classification earlier this year as a U.N. World Heritage Site .\nOn Christmas Eve , the pope presided over Mass in St. Peter 's Basilica . The service began at 10 p.m. local time , or 4 p.m . ET . The midnight start time was changed at the Vatican years ago to let the pontiff rest before a Christmas Day speech to be delivered from the basilica 's central balcony .\nIn his homily , Benedict cited the Gospel account of Mary and Joseph finding no room at an inn and ending up in a stable which sheltered the baby Jesus . He urged people to reflect upon what they find time for in their busy , technology-driven lives .\n`` The great moral question of our attitude toward the homeless , toward refugees and migrants takes on a deeper dimension : Do we really have room for God when he seeks to enter under our roof ? Do we have time and space for him ? '' the pope said .\n`` The faster we can move , the more efficient our time-saving appliances become , the less time we have . And God ? The question of God never seems urgent , '' Benedict lamented .\nThe pope worried that `` we are so 'full ' of ourselves that there is no room left for God . '' He added , `` that means there is no room for others either -- for children , for the poor , for the stranger . ''\nThe pontiff also prayed that Israelis and Palestinians live in peace and freedom , and asked the faithful to pray for strife-torn Syria as well as Lebanon and Iraq .\nIn Bethlehem , the Palestinian hosts were hopeful after a recent vote in favor of statehood in the United Nations , though the vote did little to bring them closer to independence .\nIn his annual pre-Christmas homily , the top Roman Catholic cleric in the Holy Land , Latin Patriarch Fouad Twal , said this year 's festivities were doubly joyful .\n`` The path ( to statehood ) remains long , and will require a united effort , '' said Twal , a Palestinian citizen of Jordan , at the patriarchate 's headquarters in Jerusalem 's Old City .\nThen he set off in a procession for the West Bank city of Bethlehem , Jesus ' traditional birthplace . Twal had to enter the biblical town through a massive metal gate in the barrier of towering concrete slabs Israel built between Jerusalem and Bethlehem during a wave of Palestinian suicide bombings in the last decade . The Israeli military , which controls the crossing , said it significantly eased restrictions for the Christmas season .\nIsrael , backed by the United States , opposed the statehood bid , saying it was a Palestinian ploy to bypass negotiations . Talks stalled four years ago .\nHundreds of people greeted Twal in Manger Square , outside the Church of Nativity . The mood was festive under sunny skies , with children dressed in holiday finery or in Santa costumes , and marching bands playing in the streets .\nAfter nightfall on Monday , a packed Manger Square , resplendent with strings of lights , decorations and a 17-meter Christmas tree , took on a festival atmosphere .\nA choral group from the Baptist Church in Jerusalem performed carols on one side of the square , handing out sheets of lyrics and encouraging others to sing along with songs such as `` We Wish You A Merry Christmas . ''\nFestivities led up to the Midnight Mass at St. Catherine 's Church , next to the fourth-century Church of the Nativity , built over the grotto where tradition says Jesus was born .\nAudra Kasparian , 45 , from Salt Lake City , Utah , called her visit to Bethlehem `` a life event to cherish forever . It is one of those events that is great to be a part of . ''\nChristmas is the high point of the year in Bethlehem , which , like the rest of the West Bank , is struggling to recover from the economic hard times that followed the violent Palestinian uprising against Israel that broke out in late 2000 .\nTourists and pilgrims who were scared away by the fighting have been returning in larger numbers . Last year 's Christmas Eve celebration produced the highest turnout in more than a decade , with some 100,000 visitors , including foreign workers and Arab Christians from Israel .\nThe Israeli Tourism Ministry predicted a 25 percent drop from that level this year , following last month 's clash between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza , which put a chill on tourist arrivals . Foreign tourists heading to Bethlehem must pass through Israel or the Israel-controlled border crossing into the West Bank from Jordan .\nOutside the town 's quaint Manger Square , Bethlehem is a drab , sprawling town with a dwindling Christian base .\nOverall , there are only about 50,000 Christians in the West Bank , less than 3 percent of the population , the result of a lower birthrate and increased emigration . Bethlehem 's Christians make up only a third of the town 's residents , down from 75 percent a few decades ago .\nElias Joha , a 44-year-old Christian who runs a souvenir store , said even with the U.N. recognition , this year 's celebrations were sad for him . He said most of his family has left , and that if he had the opportunity , he would do the same .\n`` These celebrations are not even for Christians because there are no Christians . It is going from bad to worse from all sides ... we are not enjoying Christmas as before . ''\nLocated on the southeastern outskirts of Jerusalem , Bethlehem has the highest unemployment in the West Bank , but the tourist boom of Christmas offered a brief reprieve . Officials say all 34 hotels in the town are fully booked for the Christmas season , including 13 new ones built this year .\nIsrael turned Bethlehem over to Palestinian civil control a few days before Christmas in 1995 , and since then , residents have been celebrating the holiday regardless of their religion . Many Muslims took part in celebration Monday as well .\nIn Iraq , Christians gathered for services with tight security , including at Baghdad 's Our Lady of Salvation church , the scene of a brutal October 2010 attack that killed more than 50 worshippers and wounded scores more .\nEarlier this month , Cardinal Leonardo Sandri , who is responsible for the Vatican 's outreach to the Middle East 's Catholic communities , traveled to Iraq and presided over a Mass to rededicate the church following renovations . In his homily , he remembered those who were killed and expressed hope that `` the tears shed in this sacred place become the good seed of communion and witness and bear much fruit , '' according to an account by Vatican Radio .\nThe exact number of Christians remaining in Iraq is not known , but it has fallen sharply from as many as 1.4 million before the U.S.-led invasion nearly a decade ago to about 400,000 to 600,000 , according community leaders cited by the U.S. State Department .","bias":2}
{"id":"2c44UQHSumURT9OO","content":"By : U.S . Senators \u2588\u2588\u2588 ( D-VA ) and Angus King ( I-ME )\nMajor tax reform is one of the most important tasks of this or any Congress . What we do in the next several months will affect every American , every business and our entire economy for decades to come . Unfortunately , those in charge of the current process seem hell bent to pass something , anything , that can be called tax reform before an arbitrary Christmas deadline , with no real input from Democrats ( or Independents ) , outside experts , states and communities affected , or ordinary citizens .\nBut it doesn \u2019 t have to be this way . There are a substantial number of Democrats who are prepared to engage in good-faith negotiations involving hearings , expert input , and compromise , to include cutting corporate rates and doing something about off-shore profits to stimulate economic growth . We believe that we can get to 70 votes , and probably more , for a more targeted ( and less costly ) alternative . The trick is to slow down , open up the process , and make sure we look before we take a thirty-year leap .\nOne of our greatest concerns about the current Senate and House bills is the long-term implication of the huge cut in revenues that both of these bills entail \u2014 which will only hasten the inevitable day of reckoning on the ballooning deficit and debt . Further , because we \u2019 re borrowing to fill the hole created by this lost revenue , these aren \u2019 t really tax cuts at all but are simply shifts of costs we \u2019 re unwilling to pay to our kids .\nAnd all this deficit spending is being done in relatively good times , using up whatever cushion we might need for future economic downturns . Any rational business would be paying down debt now , not adding to it .\nThere are lots of important ideas out there that have not gotten a hearing in the current closed process , ideas that could really make a difference in economic growth without ballooning the debt or favoring one class of taxpayers over another . For example , our Republican Senate colleague , Ron Johnson , has pointed out that the engine of economic growth is the 80+ percent of American businesses that organize in ways ( Subchapter S , limited liability companies and partnerships ) where business income is simply passed through and taxed as ordinary income of their owners .\nThe current Senate Republican tax plan , by lowering corporate rates for the 20 percent of businesses that organize as Subchapter C corporations , does less for the small businesses that truly drive the economy . So Johnson proposes a simple solution . Instead of disadvantaging small businesses , treat all businesses the same by attributing the income of Subchapter C corporations to their owners and tax that income at personal rates . The details matter in getting this right , but the Johnson concept is worth a serious look .\nWhy do tax reform wrong ? What \u2019 s the rush ? All indications are that both the House and Senate bills would disproportionately benefit the largest companies and richest individuals while offering little to small businesses and punishing millions of middle class families . The proposals explode the deficits by at least $ 1.5 trillion \u2014 and the Senate bill would even dramatically increase the ranks of those without health insurance . This is why a strong consensus of economists has emerged that this particular tax plan will do little to promote a stronger American economy .\nSurely we can do better . And we should do better . In 1986 , Congress laid the groundwork for bipartisan reform with 36 hearings over ten months . The current Senate Bill was handed to Finance Committee members less than one week before the Committee was forced to debate and vote on its provisions . No hearings with experts , no opportunity for the public to weigh in , no real opportunity for Democratic members to persuade the Republican majority to improve the bill . And , we are currently scheduled to debate the bill on the Senate floor this week under a constrained procedure where a Senator offering an amendment is given one minute \u2014 one minute ! \u2014 to debate the amendment before voting . A city council wouldn \u2019 t amend the leash law with a process like this .\nWe are former Governors \u2014 one Democrat and one Independent \u2014 who have worked on tax reform issues with legislators of both parties . We have recently been part of crafting bipartisan Senate legislation to stabilize the health insurance markets and also to better calibrate the regulation of community banks and credit unions . We know there is a path to bipartisan tax reform to spur economic growth and help hardworking individuals and small businesses succeed . If we miss the opportunity to do this right , we ( and the entire country ) are likely to regret it for years to come .","bias":0}

You have threatened nuclear war while gutting diplomacy funding . The administration pulled out of the Paris agreement , filed an amicus brief undermining the Civil Rights Act and attacked our brave trans service members . You have subverted equal protections , and are committed to banning Muslims and refugee women & children from our great country ... Your words and actions push us all away from the freedoms we are guaranteed .\nAll 17 members of the committee signed the letter , including Wolfe , who added his signature to the document after Penn \u2019 s tweet featuring the initial 16 signatories . Though the committee had not met under Trump \u2019 s administration , Politico reports that it had continued to do some of its basic work , which includes overseeing educational programs and diplomatic functions . The resignation of the full committee makes the PCAH the first White House agency to officially dissolve under President Trump .\n\u201c Supremacy , discrimination , and vitriol are not American values , \u201d the letter concluded . \u201c We must be better than this . \u201d","bias":0}

{"id":"KwzFTcon4R0N907O","content":"In less than 100 days , Democrats will gather in Charlotte , N.C. , for their presidential nominating convention .\nThe city was a natural choice after President Obama in 2008 turned a reliably red state to blue for the first time since Jimmy Carter won it in 1976 .\nSince the president squeaked out victory in the Tar Heel state , Republicans took control of the legislature for the first time in 100 years ; Democratic Gov . Bev Perdue declined to seek re-election ; unemployment moved to fifth-worst in the country ; and voters passed an amendment to ban same-sex marriage just days before Obama announced his support for gay marriage .\nAll of this has many people asking \u2013 why was it that the Democrats picked Charlotte ?\n\u201c It seemed like a good idea at the time , \u201d said Larry Sabato , director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics . \u201c It sent the right message for Democrats that they were going to fight .\n\u201c As it has happened , with lots of different events including the gay marriage referendum and the fact that some polls have Romney leading in North Carolina , maybe it wasn \u2019 t the best place to have the convention . \u201d\nScott Stone , a Republican who ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Charlotte in 2011 , agrees .\n\u201c If the ( Democratic National Committee ) chose Charlotte because they want a great venue with great folks and have a good time , they picked absolutely the right place , \u201d he told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c If they picked it because they think Charlotte is going to help them win North Carolina , they \u2019 re absolutely wrong because North Carolina will not go Democratic in 2012 . \u201d\nIt wouldn \u2019 t take much to swing North Carolina back to the red column .\nObama won there by just 14,000 votes , out of 4.2 million cast .\nStatewide polls have the race neck-and-neck , though a recent Rasmussen poll puts Romney ahead 51 percent to 43 percent .\nOf all the issues concerning North Carolina voters , same-sex marriage is perhaps the one that most shows the divide between the president and the direction of the state .\nA surprising number of black voters came out in support of the ban , revealing a split in the president \u2019 s most reliable demographic .\nCharlotte Mayor Anthony Foxx hopes voters are thinking about other things by November .\nThe same-sex amendment is \u201c one issue of a thousand that people have to think about and parse through in this election , \u201d he told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c I think , frankly , by the time the election comes around , the thing that \u2019 s going to be on most people \u2019 s minds is who is going to create more jobs . \u201d\nWhen the amendment passed , supporters of same-sex marriage appealed to the DNC to move the convention from Charlotte . A petition drive on www.change.org has drawn more than 32,000 signatures .\nThe DNC insists Charlotte is the perfect place for the Sept. 3-6 convention -- a way for the president to keep his toehold in the South and a possible route to victory in November .\n\u201c We can \u2019 t just retreat to safe territory , \u201d said DNC spokesman Brad Woodhouse . \u201c We can \u2019 t go back to a map where we \u2019 re not growing the electorate , but where we \u2019 re shrinking it . So we have to be in places like North Carolina . \u201d\nThe DNC hopes to use the convention as a focal point for a drive to register new voters and get them out to the polls in November .\n`` Without a big margin in the Charlotte area , Obama has no chance to carry North Carolina , \u201d Sabato said . `` So it is important that he use the convention as a staging ground to improve his standing which is clearly deteriorated since 2008 . ''\nGetting out the vote will be crucial for the president . But unions , one of his biggest machines , also are not pleased with the convention site .\nNorth Carolina is a right-to-work state . And unions are so upset about the location that they have withheld their important financial contribution to the convention .\nThe DNC is trying to appease them by bringing union labor in from out of state to work the event .\nThe Democrats \u2019 big bash will also offer some intriguing and possibly uncomfortable contrasts .\nWhen the president accepts his party \u2019 s nomination , he will do it in a stadium bearing the name Bank Of America , which is headquartered in the city .\nThe bank received tens of billions of dollars in federal bailout funds , much of which was used to pay executive bonuses .\nAnd the president \u2019 s relentless attack on the financial industry may not play well in a town that has reinvented itself around banking .\n\u201c He can \u2019 t keep demagoging the banks because in North Carolina , you can not compare Wall Street against Main Street , because the banks \u2013 in Charlotte \u2013 they are our main street , \u201d Stone said .","bias":2}
{"id":"JzeHNcQ2Cnz9nNUl","content":"Senators from both parties have local concerns in mind when it comes to the final bill . | AP Photos The immigration bill goes local\nThe strategy for passing immigration reform through the Senate isn \u2019 t just about striking a deal on border security .\nIt also means assuring Sen. Mark Begich ( D-Alaska ) that fish processors in his home state will be protected , meeting a request from Sen. Dean Heller ( R -Nev. ) that Nevada will be added to a border commission and guaranteeing Sen. Heidi Heitkamp ( D-N.D. ) that resources won \u2019 t be diverted from the northern border .\nAs border security dominates headlines a week before the final vote is expected , a quieter campaign is under way to address the targeted , sometimes parochial , interests of senators who are likely to support the bill but need to show that they fought for some immigration-related concession in return .\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D-Nev. ) fields the requests during private chats on the Senate floor and drop-ins to his office just outside the chamber . The asks may not be make or break for these senators \u2014 and the horse trading isn \u2019 t as intense as in past legislative fights \u2014 but attempting to meet the demands is still viewed as critical to Democratic leaders and members of the Gang of Eight who must piece together a filibuster-proof majority .\nThe challenge right now is the glacial pace of voting . The Senate has agreed to hold only a dozen votes in more than a week of debate on the Gang of Eight \u2019 s immigration overhaul . And bill proponents will need action to accelerate soon if they hope to have enough time to tackle the list of proposed changes that could lock in the support of moderate Democrats and a dozen Republicans that could put the bill over the finish line .\nEven Sen. John Hoeven ( R-N.D. ) , who led talks on a bipartisan border security agreement , was lobbied by individual senators to insert a must-have amendment in any emerging deal .\n\u201c You have got a number of members from our caucus who are looking at this , and they \u2019 re saying there isn \u2019 t any one piece that gets us there but a number of pieces could get us there , \u201d Hoeven said .\nSome of the individual demands are well known by now .\nSen. Orrin Hatch ( R-Utah ) wants to stiffen the restrictions on immigrant access to government benefits . Sen . Rob Portman ( R-Ohio ) says the language on requiring implementation of an electronic employment verification system needs to be tightened . And a number of Republicans are insisting on more specific metrics for determining whether the border is secured as a condition of their vote .\nHoeven and Sen. Bob Corker ( R-Tenn. ) were near an agreement Wednesday with the Gang of Eight that addresses those concerns , either by rolling them into one package or securing guarantees from Senate leaders that key amendments will receive votes .\nBut a border agreement could also serve as the vehicle to deal with lower-profile requests from Sens . Susan Collins ( R-Maine ) , Claire McCaskill ( D-Mo . ) and others , Hoeven said .\nCollins , a likely supporter of the overall bill , wants to remove a requirement that 90 percent of money available through a federal border security grant program known as Operation Stonegarden go to law enforcement agencies on the Southwest border . The change could free up funds for Maine .\nMcCaskill is pressing for tougher language in the bill to go after employers that repeatedly hire undocumented immigrants . It \u2019 s something she \u2019 s sought for years , and if it doesn \u2019 t make it into the Hoeven-Corker package , then she \u2019 s hoping the Senate will accept it by unanimous consent .","bias":0}
{"id":"nBAIjzzZxeAOim9m","content":"For the past year , the bridges that cross from Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez to El Paso have been surrounded by encampments of Central Americans waiting to apply for asylum in the United States . As the Trump administration clamped down even further on asylum over the summer and threatened Mexico with tariffs if it didn \u2019 t stop more Guatemalans , Hondurans , and Salvadorans from reaching the US border , those camps started to shrink\u2014until recently , when the makeshift shelters began to be occupied by a new group of would-be asylees : Mexicans .\nOn a recent afternoon near the Paso del Norte bridge , I met a petite 23-year-old woman who \u2019 s been at the encampment with her husband and three young sons for the past five weeks . They fled the cartel-stricken state of Michoac\u00e1n to seek asylum and are now sleeping on a sidewalk under a multicolor tarp .\n\u201c I wish I didn \u2019 t have to be here\u2014it \u2019 s tough living here , \u201d she told me while sitting on the sidewalk , keeping an eye on her youngest son . It was starting to get cold , and her kids had already gotten sick . But she couldn \u2019 t return to her hometown , she said . Before she headed north , a relative was murdered , his chopped-up remains delivered to the family in a bag . Shortly thereafter , there were whispers that a group in her town was kidnapping children , and when her sister , a police officer , confirmed the rumors and told her to flee , her family left immediately .\nNow , with violent outbursts on the upswing across Mexico , there are more than 3,000 Mexican asylum seekers spread out near the three international bridges in Ciudad Juarez .\nAround her at the encampment , dozens of tents and tarps lined both sides of the small street leading to the international port of entry . According to lawyers with Catholic Legal Immigration Network ( CLINIC ) and the American Civil Liberties Union , the first asylum-seeking Mexican families began settling along the border in Ju\u00e1rez in early September , after being turned away at the port of entry by US Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ) . Now , two months later\u2014with violent outbursts on the upswing across Mexico\u2014there are more than 3,000 Mexican asylum seekers spread out in camps and shelters near the three international bridges in Ju\u00e1rez , according to estimates from volunteers , NGOs , and the ACLU . ( The increase in asylum seekers coincides with an increase in the number of so-called family units from Mexico apprehended along the border : In the fiscal year that ended on September 30 , there were 6,004 Mexican family unit apprehensions , up from about 2,200 in both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 . )\nThe thing is , advocates note , US immigration officials are legally obligated to process Mexican asylum seekers at the border . \u201c They \u2019 re turning those asylum seekers right back into the country from which they \u2019 re fleeing prosecution , \u201d said Shaw Drake , policy counsel with the ACLU Border Rights Center\u2014and that \u2019 s in direct violation of US domestic and international laws signed after World War II that ensure that no state turns away refugees fleeing persecution in their home countries . Yet people at the camp say CBP officials send people back across the bridge all the time\u2014a tactic known as metering that limits the number of people asking for asylum on any given day .\nThe young family from Michoac\u00e1n found this out the hard way upon arriving in Ju\u00e1rez . On their first night there , they walked up the bridge , ready to petition for asylum at the port of entry . But before they could reach the US side of the bridge , CBP agents turned the family back to Mexico and told them they had to get on a list .\n\u201c This is illegal , this is cruel , and this is unfair . \u201d\nThese waitlists started popping up around summer 2018 , when Central American migrants trying to present themselves at legal ports of entry were told to wait in Mexico because CBP claimed it couldn \u2019 t process them in large groups . As the number of people requesting asylum grew , and as more and more migrant caravans arrived from Central America , the waitlists became the only way to get in front of a CBP official . It could be months until people \u2019 s numbers are called .\n\u201c This is illegal , this is cruel , and this is unfair , \u201d said Tania Marie Guerrero , an attorney with CLINIC who \u2019 s working at the camps daily . \u201c Ultimately , it is a judge \u2019 s job to decide who get asylum\u2014it \u2019 s not up to CBP or Border Patrol . \u201d\nSince September , a second set of waitlists has been formed , this one with the names of thousands of Mexican citizens . The afternoon I visited , the list went up to 207 at Paso del Norte . The woman from Michoac\u00e1n was number 51 . If CBP continued calling out only a few numbers each week , she \u2019 d still have months to go . Other international bridges in Ju\u00e1rez have longer lists , and since each number is likely to represent a family of three or five , it \u2019 s hard to tell exactly how many Mexican citizens are waiting .\nThe camps are growing , and more people are expected to seek asylum in the United States as a result of recent public killings and shootouts across Mexico . Videos of Sinaloa Cartel gunmen shooting at police in broad daylight in a residential neighborhood went viral last month , terrifying the whole country . Last week , in a brutal attack in northern Mexico , nine members of a Mormon family were killed by assailants , who incinerated women and children . President Donald Trump tweeted about the incident , calling drug cartels \u201c monsters \u201d and offering help to Mexico \u2019 s president to \u201c wipe them off the face of the earth. \u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R- S.C. ) said he would rather go to Syria than some places in Mexico : \u201c There \u2019 s some places over there that are completely lawless . \u201d\nOf course , that \u2019 s exactly the argument that immigration lawyers have been making for months in response to the Trump administration \u2019 s Migrant Protection Protocols ( a.k.a . \u201c Remain in Mexico \u201d ) policy , which has forced more than 50,000 migrants , mostly from Central America , to wait out their court proceedings in Mexico . Not only is Mexico unsafe , they contend , but it \u2019 s especially dangerous for these migrants in limbo along the border .\nAt an October 29 press conference , CBP Acting Commissioner Mark Morgan attributed the rise of Mexican asylum seekers to smugglers who \u201c started taking out social-media ads and telling Mexican nationals that if you grab a kid it \u2019 s your passport to the United States. \u201d That line didn \u2019 t sit well with advocates like Guerrero , who visits the camps multiple times a week and holds informational sessions for anyone who will listen to make sense of the newest policy changes regarding asylum in the United States . She constantly hears about the fear and violence families are experiencing across Mexico and about the lack of support from law enforcement . \u201c There \u2019 s nothing easy about this , \u201d Guerrero said , pointing to the encampment behind her .\nSouth Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said he would rather go to Syria than some places in Mexico : \u201c There \u2019 s some places over there that are completely lawless . \u201d\nDuring his press conference , Morgan said CBP is working with the White House \u201c and trying to develop new initiatives within the current legal framework that we can apply to the Mexican families as well. \u201d Last week , BuzzFeed News reported on a secretive CBP pilot program in El Paso that significantly reduces the time Mexican families have to prepare their asylum case while in custody\u2014making an already difficult process all but impossible to navigate for the vast majority of asylum seekers , many of whom have no access to legal counsel .\n\u201c This places asylum seekers at a complete disadvantage , setting them up for failure , \u201d Guerrero said of the pilot program . In such a short timeframe and without legal representation while in detention , these migrants are \u201c cold , sleepless , hungry , and fearful of people , \u201d yet they are \u201c expected to respond to a series of questions that will determine the rest of their lives . \u201d\nI reached out to CBP for an interview about how the agency is handling the asylum requests from Mexicans in Ju\u00e1rez but did not get a response .\nOn a recent Tuesday afternoon at the border camp , little kids ran around playing with a ball while teens huddled around a cellphone watching videos . The temperature was starting to drop ; adults sat on the sidewalks looking bored and defeated . A woman dunked a loofah in a bucket with soapy water , struggling to get her toddler to stand still while she cleaned him up . Most of the Central Americans who lived here earlier in the year are now staying in one of the many shelters that have popped up throughout the city , including a large facility the Mexican government opened in the summer at the request of the United States to help non-Mexican migrants wait out their day in court .\nThe woman from Michoac\u00e1n said that if she could \u2019 ve stayed in her hometown with her family she would \u2019 ve done so . But as I asked more questions about the life she fled back home , she started to avert her eyes and nervously rub her palms together . She explained that families like hers wished they didn \u2019 t have to sleep on the streets of Ju\u00e1rez\u2014it \u2019 s embarrassing , she said .\n\u201c Who would want to live like this ? It \u2019 s cold , and we go hungry sometimes , \u201d she said . \u201c People walk by sometimes\u2014they call us lazy and dirty. \u201d Her eyes filled with tears . Her oldest son , who \u2019 s still just seven , wrapped his arms around her and gently placed his head on her shoulder , trying to comfort her .","bias":0}

''\nWithin weeks , Romney had unveiled a universal health insurance plan that would become his signature accomplishment as he launched a 2008 bid for the White House .\nPassing that bill meant working closely with Democrats , and at its ceremonial signing at Boston 's Faneuil Hall , Romney spoke as a political uniter : `` What is noteworthy is the uncharacteristic collaboration of so many individuals and groups and partisans , '' Romney said at the time . `` And how did that happen ? I think it 's because of what this bill can lead to \u2014 every citizen with affordable , comprehensive health insurance . ''\nAt Romney 's side stood Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy , who died in 2009 . The two men had debated sharply on the same stage in 1994 during Romney 's unsuccessful bid to unseat Kennedy . But in 2006 , Kennedy had only praise for Romney : `` To our governor , and to our Senate president and our speaker , we all say , 'Well done . ' ``\nBoston University political historian Thomas Whalen says passing the state 's health care law pushed Romney well outside his comfort zone .\n`` He was capable , you know , when he was willing to , to get down in the trenches , [ to ] cut deals , pigeonhole legislators , to get his reform health care package through , '' he says . `` And he did with remarkable success . ''\nBut apart from health care , Romney defined success not with big-picture legislative accomplishments but with confrontation . In a 2008 campaign ad , Romney actually bragged about taking on his Legislature : `` I like vetoes ; I vetoed hundreds of spending appropriations as governor , '' he said .\nRomney issued some 800 vetoes , and the Legislature overrode nearly all of them , sometimes unanimously .\nAt a recent Obama re-election rally on the steps of the Massachusetts Statehouse , Democratic legislator Pat Haddad was heckled by Romney supporters as she issued this warning , suggesting that if Romney is elected president : `` You 're gon na get the same guy who never wanted to engage the Legislature . He never wanted to look for new jobs ; he was always only looking for his next job . ''\nBut Romney campaign spokesman Ryan Williams says that 's just the kind of flak you get for having been a governor who shook up the status quo : `` Obviously , when you do that and make the tough decisions , you 're not going to make friends everywhere . ''\nEspecially not in the Statehouse , where Romney 's office was just down the hall from the House chamber .\nStanding outside that chamber , Democrat Ellen Story recalls a Gov . Romney who had a policeman screen visitors and who did not allow lawmakers to use the bank of elevators just outside his office :\n`` He was aloof ; he was not approachable , '' Story says . `` He was very much an outsider , the whole time he was here . ''\nAnd Story remembers something else about the former governor : `` The Republican reps would grumble that he did n't even know their names . ''\nGeorge Peterson was one of those Republicans ; he does not take issue with his colleague 's characterization of Romney : `` It took him a little bit to get used to dealing with elected officials , let 's put it that way , '' he says .\n`` The first year was , I 'd say , a struggle , '' Peterson says . `` He was used to being a top executive , 'and this is where we 're going , and this is how we 're going to do it . ' And this animal [ the state Legislature ] does n't work that way . Not at all . Especially when it 's overwhelmingly ruled by one party . ''\nStill , former Massachusetts Senate Minority Leader Richard Tisei says Romney proved his mettle tackling a $ 3 billion deficit .\n`` He walked into a very difficult situation , and I think the fact that he was able to close the budget gap without increasing income or sales or any other broad-based tax , No . 1 . And No . 2 , he was able to control spending . ''\nAt the time , Tisei says , people in Massachusetts really appreciated Romney 's effort . Still , this week , the Obama campaign came out with a new ad that aims to turn Romney 's time as governor against him , saying the state under Romney had `` one of the worst economic records in the country . ''\nBut by the end of his term , Romney 's approval rating in Massachusetts was only 34 percent . In recent polls , the number has barely changed .\nFor political historian Whalen , that 's not surprising : `` I think Romney 's biggest problem here in Massachusetts is not that he necessarily did a disastrous job . He did n't . But he raised the expectation bar so high that , you know , he just did n't deliver. ``\nWhich is the same critique often leveled against the president whom Romney seeks to unseat .","bias":1}

Japan will host the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics beginning July 23 , 2021 .\nThe 67-page report , \u201c \u2018 I Was Hit So Many Times I Can \u2019 t Count \u2019 : Abuse of Child Athletes in Japan , \u201d documents Japan \u2019 s history of corporal punishment in sport \u2013 known as taibatsu in Japanese \u2013 and finds child abuse in sports training throughout Japanese schools , federations , and elite sports . In interviews and a nationwide online survey , Japanese athletes from more than 50 sports reported abuses that included being punched in the face , kicked , beaten with objects like bats or bamboo kendo sticks , being deprived of water , choked , whipped with whistles or racquets , and being sexually abused and harassed .\n\u201c For decades , children in Japan have been brutally beaten and verbally abused in the name of winning trophies and medals , \u201d said Minky Worden , director of global initiatives at \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c As Japan prepares to host the Olympics and Paralympics in Tokyo in July 2021 , the global spotlight brings a once-in-a-generation opportunity to change laws and policies in Japan and around the world to protect millions of child athletes . \u201d\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 documented experiences of more than 800 former child athletes \u2013 more than 50 from in-person interviews , and 757 from an online survey \u2013 including Olympians and Paralympians . The survey had participants from 45 of the 47 Japanese prefectures , and 50 sports . \u2588\u2588\u2588 also monitored Japanese media reports of child abuse in sport , contacted sports federations to assess the availability of hotlines , interviewed academics , journalists , parents , and coaches , and met in person with government and sport federation officials .\nIn 2013 , while Japan was bidding to host the 2020 Olympics , a series of videos of high-profile elite athlete abuse cases , coupled with suicides of child athletes , spurred leading sports agencies to speak out on the need for child protection in sport . In 2018 , a video surfaced showing an Aichi prefecture high school baseball coach repeatedly slapping , punching , and kicking the players on his team . In the video , the coach is seen striking at least five players hard enough to cause the teenage athletes to stagger backward .\nPublic outrage led to important reforms such as setting up hotlines to report abuse . However , \u2588\u2588\u2588 found that these reforms are optional \u201c guidelines \u201d instead of rules , that progress has been uneven and unmonitored , and that there is no mandatory reporting of abuse complaints or statistics .\nThis abuse violates Japanese laws against child abuse , international human rights standards , and International Olympic Committee regulations on safeguarding athletes .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 found that child abuse in sport remains accepted and normalized in many parts of society , and that it is difficult for young athletes to file complaints against a powerful coach or official . Schools and federations rarely punish abusive coaches , often allowing them to continue coaching , \u2588\u2588\u2588 said .\n\u201c Sports federations in Japan are allowed to set up their own systems to track abuse and abusers \u2013 which many simply choose not to do , \u201d said Kanae Doi , Japan director at \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c This exposes children to unacceptable risks , and leaves parents and athletes with few options to file complaints or seek remedies against powerful abusers . \u201d\nChild abuse in sport is a global problem with a lack of unified , clear systems to address violence and abuse . The burden of reporting abuse is often on the victims , while the systems for reporting are opaque , unresponsive , and inadequate .\nWorldwide , coaches and other abusers go unpunished or are promoted to positions in which they can threaten and silence their accusers . Two presidents of sports federations , in Haiti and Afghanistan , have been accused of sexual assault of female athletes over the last 18 months . The United States Olympic doctor Larry Nassar abused hundreds of female gymnasts over decades . Children and teens who come forward are often not believed when accusing powerful coaches who hold the athletes \u2019 success hostage . On June 26 , according to the New York Times , 22-year-old South Korean triathlete Choi Suk-hyeon commtited suicide after filing many complaints with sport and government officials about the physical and psychological abuse she suffered .\n\u201c Sport can bring benefits like health , scholarships , and careers , but too often victims of abuse experience suffering and despair , \u201d said Takuya Yamazaki , a sports lawyer on the Executive Committee of the World Players Association , the global athletes \u2019 trade union who partnered with \u2588\u2588\u2588 on the report . \u201c One of the reasons why it is so hard to deal with cases of abuse is that athletes are not encouraged to have a voice . Just like the many brave athletes who are increasingly speaking up for their rights , sports bodies must show courage to deal with the past , if sport is to be a true force for good . \u201d\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s main recommendation is that the country set up a Japan Center for Safe Sport , an independent administrative body tasked with addressing child abuse in Japanese sport to ensure reporting and tracking of abuse complaints , establish meaningful remedies for athletes and parents , and deter child abuse by identifying and decertifying abusive coaches .\nWith the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games delayed until Summer 2021 , Japan has one year to take convincing action before the games begin , \u2588\u2588\u2588 said .\n\u201c Taking decisive action to protect child athletes will send a message to Japan \u2019 s children that their health and well-being are more important than medals \u2013 while placing abusive coaches on notice that their behavior will no longer be tolerated , \u201d Worden said . \u201c If Japan acts now , it can serve as a model for how other countries can end child abuse in sports . \u201d\nPlease see below for quotes from some of the child and former child athletes interviewed .\n\u201c I was hit so many times , I can \u2019 t count . Everyone [ on my current team ] was hit as high school athletes , everyone experienced taibatsu . I was playing baseball as a pitcher .... The coach told me I was not serious enough with the running [ during practice ] , so we were all called to the coach and I was hit in the face in front of everyone .

( AP Photo\/David Zalubowski )\nHIGHLANDS RANCH , Colo. ( AP ) \u2014 When a gunman burst into his high school classroom , Kendrick Castillo did not hesitate .\nThe 18-year-old immediately charged , pinning the attacker to the wall before Castillo was fatally shot protecting classmates , witnesses said . As he charged , so did two other students . One of them , Brendan Bialy , wrestled the gun from the shooter \u2019 s hand and the students subdued him .\nA second shooter was captured by an armed security guard .\nAuthorities said these acts of bravery helped minimize the bloodshed from Tuesday \u2019 s attack , which also wounded eight people .\n\u201c We \u2019 re going to hear about very heroic things that have taken place at the school , \u201d Douglas County Sheriff Tony Spurlock said Wednesday .\nThe attackers were identified by law enforcement officials as 18-year-old Devon Erickson and a 16-year-old who prosecutors identified as Maya McKinney but whose attorney said uses male pronouns and the name Alec . The two allegedly walked into the STEM School Highlands Ranch through an entrance without metal detectors and opened fire in two classrooms .\nBecause the attack happened only miles from Columbine High School and just weeks after the shooting \u2019 s 20th anniversary , questions quickly arose about whether it was inspired by the 1999 massacre . But investigators offered no immediate motive .\nCastillo sprang into action against the shooter \u201c and immediately was on top of him with complete disregard for his own safety , \u201d said Bialy , a close friend of Castillo \u2019 s who has signed up to join the Marines .\nA member of the school \u2019 s robotics club and a relentless tinkerer , Castillo had an infectious smile and gentle sense of humor , according to friends . He worked part-time at a local manufacturing company that had offered him a job after an internship because he was such a standout employee .\n\u201c To find he went down as a hero , I \u2019 m not surprised . That \u2019 s exactly who Kendrick was , \u201d said Rachel Short , president of the company , Baccara .\nCecilia Bedard , 19 , had known Castillo since elementary school and said he was always friendly , modest and excited to help people . He made a point of always joining his father at Knights of Columbus fundraisers and bingo nights .\n\u201c He was amazing , \u201d Bedard said . \u201c He was honestly the sweetest kid I ever met . Never said a mean joke . \u201d\nBialy smiled as he recounted the struggle with the shooter to reporters , saying that he wanted to focus on the positive . \u201c They completely and utterly failed in a matter of half a minute , \u201d he said of the attackers .\n\u201c What I saw yesterday was the absolute best of people , \u201d he added .\nBialy would not identify the third student who helped subdue the gunman , but the family of Joshua Jones put out a statement saying he was shot twice while disarming one of the attackers .\nThe security guard who detained the second armed suspect was employed by Boss High Level Protection , a company started by a former SWAT team leader who responded to the Columbine shooting . The owner , Grant Whitus , told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 the security guard is a former Marine who ran to the area of the shootings and confronted one of the armed students in a hallway .\nThe guard drew his weapon and apprehended the person , Whitus said .\n\u201c He doesn \u2019 t even realize how many lives he saved by stopping a school shooting , \u201d Whitus said .\nAbout 2,000 people held a vigil at a nearby high school Wednesday night to honor the victims and survivors of the attack .\nBoth suspects were students at the school , and they were not previously known to authorities , Spurlock said .\nErickson made his first court appearance Wednesday and kept his head down . His black hair , streaked with purple dye , covered his face as he nodded in response to most of District Court Judge Theresa Slade \u2019 s questions . At one point , the judge requested a verbal answer to whether he had any questions about the proceedings . Erickson simply replied \u201c No . \u201d\nMcKinney , who has a short brown haircut , made eye contact with the judge and answered questions in a clear but quiet voice , saying \u201c Yes , your honor \u201d and \u201c No , your honor . \u201d\nDistrict attorney George Brauchler said he has not decided whether to file adult charges but added that McKinney is old enough to be charged as an adult without a judge \u2019 s review .\nFormal charges were expected to be filed by Friday . Brauchler said he could not discuss any motive or weapons used in the attack .\nA message left at a phone number listed for Erickson \u2019 s home was not immediately returned .\nJosh Dutton , 18 , said he was close friends with Erickson in middle school but had not seen him for four years while attending a different high school . On Sunday , he spotted Erickson at a local light rail station and said he was shocked at how much his friend had changed .\nErickson wore all black and was significantly thinner and did not seem interested in talking .\n\u201c He said he \u2019 d just turned 18 and he owned rifles , \u201d Dutton said .\nThe shooting took place exactly a week after a gunman killed two students and wounded four at the University of North Carolina-Charlotte . In that case as well , one of the fatalities was a student who charged the attacker .\nThe Colorado attack unfolded came nearly three weeks after neighboring Littleton marked the anniversary of the Columbine attack that killed 13 people . The two schools are separated by about 7 miles ( 11 kilometers ) in adjacent communities south of Denver .\nBrauchler said the community remains resilient in the face of multiple shootings , including Columbine , the 2012 theater shooting in the Denver suburb of Aurora and the 2013 shooting at Arapahoe High School .\nThe attacks are \u201c aberrant acts \u201d although they might seem otherwise to the rest of the world , he said . \u201c Who we are is a kind , compassionate , caring people , and this does not define us . \u201d\nThis story has been updated to correct the name of the student who charged the shooter to Joshua Jones , instead of Jason Jones .","bias":1}
{"id":"f8lCNjofdCpPQ0Bm","content":"Before the end of the day , a budget-busting , deficit-hiking , $ 2.7 trillion spending deal will probably be on its way to President Donald Trump 's desk , and he appears willing to sign it .\nBut you would n't know about that if you watched this week 's Democratic primary debates .\nThe Senate is poised for a final vote on the budget deal later Thursday\u2014the bill cleared the House with bipartisan support last week , after Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D\u2013Calif . ) and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin hammered out the details last month . The two-year , $ 2.7 trillion budget deal hikes federal spending by about $ 320 billion annually and is estimated to add about $ 1.7 trillion to the national debt over the next decade . It also shatters budget caps . It actually hikes spending above the pre-sequester baseline that was in place prior to the 2011 budget deal , which temporarily reduced federal spending and brought an end to trillion-dollar deficits for a few years .\nThat Senate vote was supposed to take place Wednesday , but was postponed a day amid rumors that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R\u2013Ky . ) was having a difficult time getting a majority of his caucus to back the plan , Politico reported yesterday . Under longstanding unwritten Senate rules , a so-called `` majority of the majority '' must approve of legislation in behind-closed-doors meetings before it will be brought to the floor .\nSo there 's a sliver a hope for fiscal sanity in Washington , D.C. , today , with some prominent conservatives openly opposing the deal . Sen. Mitt Romney ( R\u2013Utah ) says he will vote against the plan because it `` perpetuates fiscal recklessness . '' Both senators from Florida , Marco Rubio and Rick Scott , are on the record in opposition . So are Sen. Mike Lee ( R\u2013Utah ) and Sen. Pat Toomey ( R\u2013Penn . ) , both well-known as fiscal conservatives .\nIt 's more likely that the eventual vote will be , as Sen. Rand Paul ( R\u2013Ky . ) said Wednesday on the Senate floor , `` the last nail in the coffin '' of the Tea Party\u2014the grassroots conservative movement that sprung up a decade ago to oppose higher spending and bigger deficits , only to be largely subsumed into the Trump takeover of the GOP . Paul also plans to vote against the plan .\nIf Republicans ca n't muster enough opposition to stop the deficit-increasing budget deal from passing , it 's unlikely that Democrats will . Even with the $ 2.7 trillion budget deal hanging in the balance , Democratic candidates for president did not utter a single word about the national debt or federal deficit during the debates in Detroit this week .\nThere was some robust discussion of health care spending\u2014which accounts for about 40 percent of federal outlays\u2014but only in the context of debating how much more of Americans heath care costs the government should cover . Questions focusing on how Democrats would pay for Medicare for All and other health care proposals were mostly brushed off by candidates as `` Republican talking points '' \u2014a barb that actually gives Republicans far more credit than they deserve , given their recent budgetary track record .\nMaybe CNN should take most of the blame for this . Its debate moderators spent more than four hours over two nights grilling 20 presidential hopefuls , yet they did not see fit to ask a single question about the $ 22 trillion ( and growing ) national debt\u2014and the candidates , unsurprisingly , did not bring it up on their own .\nConsidering that several of the candidates on the state are current members of the U.S. Senate , the very legislative body that will vote on the budget deal Thursday , CNN missed an important and obvious opportunity for voters to draw distinctions among the 20-member debate field .\nWould any of the candidates have offered even the slightest suggestion that adding trillions more to the $ 22 trillion national debt might be an error we 'll regret later ? Maybe we 'll find out at the next debate in September , but do n't hold your breath .","bias":2}

Rispone has been endorsed by President Donald Trump , Senators Bill Cassidy and John Kennedy , Congressmen Ralph Abraham , Steve Scalise , and Mike Johnson , and Duck Dynasty CEO Willie Robertson .\nDespite his promise not to raises taxes as Governor , John Bel Edwards has raised billions of dollars in tax increases on hardworking Louisianans . \u201c You have a governor , John Bel Edwards , who ran [ in 2015 ] promising not to raise taxes . That was a lie , \u201d explained Norquist .\nNorquist went on , \u201c [ H ] e raised taxes and said \u2018 oh it \u2019 s only going be temporary. \u2019 That was a lie. \u201d Edwards enacted a 25 percent sales tax increase \u2013 which took the state sales tax rate from 4 to 5 cents on the dollar and resulted in Louisiana having the highest combined state and local sales tax rate in the country that year \u2013 on the promise that it would be temporary .\nTo put the magnitude of that tax hike in perspective , the 2016 edition of the National Conference of State Legislatures \u2019 ( NCSL ) State Tax Actions report found \u201c [ c ] ollective actions taken by the 50 states resulted in a net tax increase of $ 2.3 billion. \u201d Louisiana \u2019 s penny sales tax hike made up $ 1.5 billion of that amount.The report also notes that just 6 states \u201c reported a net tax increase of more than 1 percent \u201d that year .\nAdding insult to injury , that \u201c temporary \u201d sales tax increase has turned out to be less temporary than originally advertised . Rather than letting the entire penny expire , Edwards called three special sessions \u2013 each costing taxpayers tens of thousands of dollars a day \u2013 until the legislature finally caved into renewing 0.45 cents of the expiring penny . Norquist explained , \u201c [ Edwards ] continued what was supposed to be a temporary tax \u2013 part of it \u2013 and called that a tax cut . That was a lie . \u201d\nThe 2018 edition of NCSL \u2019 s State Tax Actions report concluded that \u201c [ c ] ollective actions taken by the 50 states and the District of Columbia resulted in a net tax increase of about $ 1.3 billion. \u201d Further , the report also found that the sales and use tax had the largest net tax change , increasing $ 847.1 million . Due to John Bel Edward \u2019 s 0.45-cent sales tax renewal , which he claims was a \u201c tax cut , \u201d Louisiana contributed $ 466 million \u2013 more than half \u2013 to that amount .\n\u201c It was a lie that he wouldn \u2019 t raise taxes . It was a lie that it was going to be temporary . It was a lie that he cut taxes when he raised them again , just not as much the second time , \u201d Norquist summarized .\nIn addition to the sales tax hikes , without legislative approval , Edwards alsoimposed an income tax hike on Louisianans . Louisiana is a one of a few states that allows taxpayers to subtract their federal taxes when calculating their income for state tax purposes . Since the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act \u2013 which reduced income tax rates across the board , doubled the standard deduction , and doubled the child tax credit , among other things \u2013 has resulted in most Americans having a lower federal tax burden , Louisianans experienced an inadvertent income tax hike at the state level .\nEdwards could have easily prevented that tax hike , however , by following the lead of Governors in other states , such as Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds and Georgia Governor Nathan Deal , who used the excess revenue their states would have otherwise collected due to the way they conform to the federal tax code by enacting rate reducing tax reform . Instead , Edwards kept the cash .\n\u201c This is a time when Louisiana is surrounded by states that are reducing taxes . Louisiana is the high tax state , \u201d noted Norquist . Louisiana has the highest corporate tax in the region , the second highest individual income tax in the region , and the second highest combined state and local sales tax in the nation .\nState Top Marginal Corporate Tax Rate Top Marginal Individual Income Tax Rate Combined State and Local Sales Tax Rate Alabama 6.50 % 5 % 9.14 % Arkansas 6.50 % 6.90 % 9.43 % Florida 5.50 % -- 7.05 % Louisiana 8 % 6 % 9.45 % Mississippi 5 % 5 % 7.07 % Tennessee 6.50 % 2 % on interest and dividend income * 9.47 % Texas -- -- 8.19 %\nWhile Arkansas \u2019 s top individual income tax rate is higher than Louisiana \u2019 s , they are interested in reducing it . Tennessee \u2019 s combined state and local sales tax rate is higher than Louisiana \u2019 s , but it does not tax wage income and has a lower corporate tax .\n\u201c Cutting taxes and telling the trial lawyers that they can \u2019 t have these imaginary lawsuits that steal money from business and kill jobs . Those are the two things Louisiana needs to do to attract jobs and opportunity and growth , and those are the two things , because of his corrupt associations , that Edwards can not do , \u201d explained Norquist .\nThe upcoming election will determine if Louisiana continues the liberal tax and spend agenda of Governor Edwards , which has resulted in Louisiana having the second highest poverty rate in the nation and being the only state in the country to lose jobs last year . \u201c [ If Edwards is reelected ] there is going to be a big \u201c don \u2019 t invest here \u201d sign on Louisiana for the next couple of years , \u201d said Norquist .\nOr , will Louisiana voters decide they want to change courses and adopt more pro-growth policies , including rate reducing tax reform , that will make their state a more attractive place to live , invest , and do business .","bias":2}

For those of us who love our country , it \u2019 s understandable to focus on the catastrophe of the last seven years . President Obama \u2019 s agenda combined with his feckless and juvenile approach to governing has made clear what we need to reverse and fix .\nBut even more important is to recognize what we \u2019 ve learned . Acknowledging how resilient the American people are and how strong the Founders \u2019 foundation for the nation really is couldn \u2019 t be more important .\nI \u2019 m reminded of the strength of the Constitution and all our founding documents when the left unleashes one of their regular howls ; 2015 was a banner year for harpies and trolls with liberals wailing and whining that the Constitution should be changed , or amendments be smashed . You know , so they can have \u201c safe spaces . \u201d\nWhat has kept the United States from being consumed by the dogs of the left is the work of our original remarkable men and women . They knew their new nation must be built upon a foundation meant specifically to stop disturbed people and the tyranny they unleash .\nEven a divinely inspired nation is only as good as her defenders , and this is where we come in . Mr. Obama and his henchmen may have run rampant over the country while abandoning the world to monsters , but that stain does not need to remain .\nThe new year will be difficult , there \u2019 s no doubt about that . Mr. Obama has only 12 more months to crash through the rest of the china shop , but it is also a challenge that is dwarfed by what generations before us faced .\nOur main job in 2016 is to stay focused , disciplined and to remember , this isn \u2019 t a fight for one person , it is the defense of the nation . We are to be partisans \u2014 for the United States of America .\nFor years we have sent hints and direct messages of our discontent to Washington and the establishment . Finally , we are on the edge of wresting our great nation away from politicians who believe it \u2019 s their personal property \u2014 who consider their position and power as some sort of entitlement .\nThere are signs that the bureaucrats of what GOP presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz calls the \u201c Washington Cartel \u201d also understand this is a last stand for them . I \u2019 ve enjoyed seeing Jeb Bush and the sanctimonious John Kasich languish in the polls , while watching two men loathed by the establishment rise .\nWhy ? Because the catastrophic state of the nation and the world belongs squarely in the lap of every idiotic and self-obsessed career politician . For the last 27 years we have watched the Establishment facilitate this disaster by going along to get along .\nA world facing an army of Charles Mansons ; the childish and incompetent destruction of our health insurance and health care system because someone wanted a legacy but had no idea what he was doing , then lied about it ; universities and colleges frozen by a movement of leftist bullies who demand people be punished and fired for what they say and think ; open borders ; Islamic State plots in all 50 states ; urban riots against the police ; historically high numbers of Americans off the work rolls , and on food stamps ; a government campaign to disarm Americans while the same Feds work feverishly to import foreigners most likely to be terrorists .\nThe list is endless , and it \u2019 s not just because Mr. Obama was elected president . He does complain a great deal , still , about what he \u201c inherited \u201d from President George W. Bush . But what Mr. Obama actually had waiting for him was a gift for a malignant narcissist : a government so massive , bureaucratic and unaccountable that his juvenile incompetence and pathological vindictiveness would go unrecognized for years .\nIt is those who have ignored , excused and facilitated the menace we have faced for seven years \u2014 the machine of both parties , the establishment \u2014 who now understand we will not be going gently into that good night .\nThe Establishment meltdown over this serious rebellion by the hoi polloi is made obvious in comments by two long-time Republican operatives .\nRick Wilson is a \u201c GOP Media Guy \u201d and Republican political consultant from Florida . In an October television interview about real estate mogul and GOP front-runner Donald Trump , he stated , \u201c [ T ] he donor class can \u2019 t just sit back on the sidelines and say , \u2018 oh well , don \u2019 t worry , this will all work itself out. \u2019 \u2026 They \u2019 re still going to have to go out and put a bullet in Donald Trump , and that \u2019 s a fact , \u201d Breitbart News reported .\nJust a week ago , Pat Brady , the Illinois co-chairman for Ohio Gov . John Kasich \u2019 s presidential campaign , told WGN Radio in Chicago and reported in Mediaite , \u201c If you \u2019 re going to take on Donald Trump , you \u2019 ve got to take him out with a head shot , \u201d later adding , \u201c You got ta be ready to rip his head off . \u201d\nPolls are usually not a good indication of where political races stand , but Mr. Trump \u2019 s strength is undeniable . Mr. Cruz \u2019 s rise is also becoming as apparent on the ground as Mr. Trump \u2019 s .\nWhat does the establishment say about this turn of events ? If either of these men wins the Republican nomination , the party , we are warned , is finished , the nation will fail , and dogs and cats will begin sleeping with each other .\nThe truth is , Republicans are not horribly divided or fearful ; they are angry and concerned . They \u2019 re also tired of being lied to and watching their future be washed away by disconnected , self-obsessed politicians . Replacing failed leadership is not an abandonment of the system that the Founding Fathers put in place \u2014 it \u2019 s a restoration .\nThis is the goal of 2016 . It is clear , straightforward and undeniable . This is our generation \u2019 s challenge , it is our Yorktown , our arrival on the beaches at Normandy . We must get it right , and if history is any indication , we will . Or as a comment attributed to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill reminds us , \u201c You can always count on Americans to do the right thing \u2014 after they \u2019 ve tried everything else. \u201d Here \u2019 s to 2016 .","bias":2}

But the bill will need 60 votes to clear the Senate , meaning at least six Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents would have to vote yes .\nThat looks to be nearly impossible . A survey of several Democratic senators who have been critical of the executive action found most saying they would not support the effort .\n\u201c I \u2019 m not looking for a political fight .

King does not support the House bill to defund the president \u2019 s executive action on immigration , \u201d she said . \u201c Withholding funds from the Department of Homeland Security would be particularly dangerous at a time of worldwide terrorist threats. \u201d An aide to Sen. Claire McCaskill ( D. , Mo . ) said she believes `` the only responsible way for Republicans to supersede this executive order is to finally consider , debate and vote on comprehensive immigration reform .

It would kill his plan , announced in November , to temporarily shield millions of people from deportation , primarily parents of U.S. citizens and permanent residents who have been in the U.S. for at least five years . It would also kill a 2012 program that offered similar shelter to people brought to the U.S. illegally as children\u2014a sharp turnout from two years ago , when leading House Republicans were discussing a GOP version of the Dream Act , which offers a permanent legal status for this group .\nIn addition , the plan would roll back Mr. Obama \u2019 s directive to prioritize deportation of recent border crossers and those with serious criminal records\u2014a policy that gives a measure of security to illegal immigrants who do not meet those criteria .

{"id":"cUqGlySFPfYoFUfR","content":"Most of the world outside the United States has reached the end of the beginning of the novel coronavirus pandemic . New confirmed infections and deaths have plateaued and are beginning to fall in some of the hardest-hit countries like Italy and Spain , and Germany is beginning to draw up plans for re-starting its economy . ( It seems that only Brazil , with its crackpot far-right president Jair Bolsonaro , is failing as badly as the U.S. , with perhaps the U.K. in a close second . )\nWe 're beginning to see a glimmering of what it will take to be able to restore some semblance of normal life . Countries will need to keep a `` test and track '' apparatus going , and they will need to be ready to reimpose lockdown measures on a moment 's notice . Unfortunately , there is no sign whatsoever that the U.S. government is even thinking about what will be required , much less actually preparing to make it happen .\nThe German plan will include `` mandatory mask-wearing in public , limits on gatherings and the rapid tracing of infection chains , '' Reuters reports . The idea is to allow people to leave their homes , and use testing and tracking to `` make it possible to track more than 80 percent of people with whom an infected person had contact within 24 hours of diagnosis . '' Anybody with the disease will be quarantined , along with anyone they had contact with . If all goes well , the rate of new infections will be low enough that the pandemic will eventually fizzle out .\nNow , this is a dangerous thing to attempt , because relaxing lockdown measures recreates the conditions that allowed the virus to spread in the first place . Even the Asian countries like Singapore , Hong Kong , and South Korea which were able to initially squelch their outbreaks have been forced to reinstate controls when new small outbreaks were seeded by international travelers .\nBut the German government likely does have the bureaucratic competence necessary to keep track of the virus . Germany has been slammed by the virus , with over 100,000 confirmed cases , but its death rate is far less than similarly-afflicted countries like Italy and Spain . One reason is that , as Katrin Bennhold writes at The New York Times , the German government has coordinated an excellent medical response . It has a robust hospital and insurance system , secured big stockpiles of medical supplies , ramped up testing , tracking , and quarantine systems very quickly ( learning from South Korea ) , and deployed `` corona taxis '' where medics check in on infected patients at home to see if they were likely to need hospitalization \u2014 making it much more likely they will survive .\nFor countries looking to emulate the German example , it will probably be necessary to keep some measures like universal mask-wearing in place not just for the next month , but for as long as it takes to develop a vaccine , as well as limits on international travel . For instance , the World Health Organization might certify nations as coronavirus free when they have had no diagnosed cases for a month and broad statistical sampling finds no cases in the wild , in which case their citizens could travel to other clean nations mostly normally . Anyone coming from infected countries would have to travel wearing full-body protective gear , be tested before and after arriving , and be quarantined for two weeks when they arrive . ( Airline pilots and flight attendants would also have to take special precautions . )\nThe United States , unfortunately , is not even considering German-style steps . We are not testing at remotely their scale , our hospitals are being overwhelmed , and still the federal government is refusing to coordinate the purchase of medical supplies . Indeed , in a sane world it would be coordinating not just with American states but with other countries as well ; instead President Trump is interfering with blue states in their attempts to get masks and ventilators . Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker ( a Republican ) had to send out a New England Patriots jet to snag 1.2 million N95 masks from China .\nMore importantly , the test-and-track strategy requires a big , expensive surveillance apparatus to monitor people 's movements and contacts . You need to test anyone with symptoms as well as the broader population , quarantine anyone who tests positive , and then quarantine anyone who has been in contact with a positive case . Investigators need to be fast and accurate : If they stay on top of things , then small outbreaks can be nipped in the bud , but a single missed contact can lead to a super-spreader event that creates hundreds of new cases .\nIn the best of times , the American government would surely struggle to implement anything like this . Today we basically do not have a national government . Under Trump , it `` has essentially abdicated its traditional role of spearheading a coordinated response , '' Matt Yglesias writes at Vox . It has fallen to states and city governments to do what they see fit , but even the ones who are taking the crisis seriously have neither the resources nor the power to set up a testing and contact-tracing system across the whole country .\nAnd it 's not just Trump , either . No national leader is even talking about testing and tracking in a serious way \u2014 not Mitch McConnell , not Chuck Schumer , and not Nancy Pelosi . With Congress unbelievably still in recess , and neither legislative branch willing to set up a remote voting system , Congress has prevented itself from even suggesting such policies until April 20 \u2014 which may not even be possible if too many members get infected . Nor is likely Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden talking about it ; his coronavirus response plan has a lot of good ideas but nothing about a huge nationwide virus-tracking system that would help us transition out of the crisis .\nSo long as Donald Trump remains in office , the Republican Party remains in his thrall , and Democrats remain utterly feckless , the only way to safely reopen American society will be to wait for a vaccine , or wait until enough people have recovered from the virus that herd immunity causes the pandemic to fizzle out . Either option will probably take more than a year , the latter could have a death toll in the millions .\nWant more essential commentary and analysis like this delivered straight to your inbox ?

In addition , the White House championed achievements made by Iraqi fighters in other parts of Iraq when asked about the comment at a press briefing the following week .\n\u201c We have \u2014 and this is something that Secretary Carter has also discussed \u2014 we have seen a number of situations in which Iraqi Security Forces have performed well on the battlefield in the effort to retake Tikrit , \u201d White House spokesman Josh Earnest said . \u201c They demonstrated not just the will to fight , but important capabilities that allowed them to succeed on the battlefield . \u201d\nThis wasn \u2019 t the first time Mr. Carter seemed to undermine the White House \u2019 s narrative .\nIn February , during his confirmation hearing , Sen. John McCain , chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , asked Mr. Carter what he understood to be the White House \u2019 s strategy in combating the Islamic State , and Mr. Carter struggled to provide an answer \u2014 indicating to lawmakers the administration \u2019 s strategy was unclear .\n\u201c I think the strategy connects ends and means , and our ends with respect to ISIL need to be its lasting defeat . I say lasting because , when they get defeated , it \u2019 s important they stay defeated , \u201d Mr. Carter said . \u201c That is why it is important that , uh , we have , uh , those on the ground there who will ensure they will stay defeated once defeated . \u201d\nTo which Mr. McCain , Arizona Republican , said it \u201c didn \u2019 t sound like a strategy \u201d to him .\nMr. Obama acknowledged Monday his administration and its international partners still don \u2019 t have a \u201c complete strategy \u201d for combating the terrorist group , and said it and the Pentagon were crafting a plan to better recruit , train and equip Iraqi Security Forces , who at times have been overrun by Islamic State militants .\nDespite not being always in lockstep with the White House , it \u2019 s unlikely Mr. Carter will be pushed from his position like his predecessor , Chuck Hagel , the senator from Nebraska who reportedly fell out of favor with the White House as the Islamic State began to rise .\nMr. Carter is essentially guaranteed the job for the remainder of Mr. Obama \u2019 s tenure , since naming a new secretary is a lengthy , difficult process that would only give Republicans ammunition against Democrats in an election year , analysts say . Mr. Carter is the fourth secretary of defense in the Obama administration . President George W. Bush had two defense secretaries during his two terms , and President Clinton had three .\nOthers who have served under Mr. Obama recalled frustrations once safely out of office .\nLeon E. Panetta , who served as defense secretary from 2011 to 2013 , blasted Mr. Obama in his memoir and subsequent interviews , saying the president had \u201c lost his way \u201d and \u201c created a vacuum \u201d for the Islamic State . Robert M. Gates , who also held the position , also wrote a book critical of the administration .\nIt was reported that Mr. Hagel was \u201c very , very frustrated \u201d as a member of the Obama Cabinet and its micromanagement , although Mr. Hagel hasn \u2019 t voiced his opinions since leaving the post this year .\nWhile Mr. Carter would never intentionally step out and directly disagree with the president who nominated him , he will continue to publicly and clearly state his point of view and not cower to the White House , said Gordon Adams , a professor of foreign policy at American University .\n\u201c Carter is an honest man , \u201d Mr. Adams said . His remarks regarding the Iraqis \u2019 will to fight may have been because Mr. Carter felt \u201c a signal needed to be sent to Iraqis that America \u2019 s patience was not unlimited , \u201d Mr. Adams said .\nNot all of Mr. Obama \u2019 s top military advisers have been as forthright in speaking as openly and honestly about issues of national security as has Mr. Carter , said Mr. Adams . For former Obama administration secretaries Mr. Gates , Mr. Panetta and Mr. Hagel , that was just \u201c not the way they worked , \u201d he said .\nMr. Carter \u2019 s successful tenure as deputy secretary of defense paved the way to an easy confirmation in the Senate earlier this year . He offered opinions that weren \u2019 t exactly in line with the administration even before taking the job , testifying during his confirmation hearing that he supported providing lethal arms to Ukrainians fighting Russian separatists . He also promised to recommend changes if he thought they were necessary in the president \u2019 s exit strategy for Afghanistan .\nMr. Carter \u2019 s independent remarks during his confirmation hearing also drew the ire of the White House , with Mr . Earnest stating : \u201c Well , the other thing that I noticed that Dr. Carter mentioned in his hearing is that he \u2019 s a strong believer in the chain of command , and he certainly understands that the commander in chief is the top of that chain of command and that a decision like this will be made by the commander in chief . \u201d\nBefore taking the top job at the Pentagon , Mr. Carter was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University , served on the faculty at Harvard University \u2019 s John F. Kennedy School of Government and started out in the government in the Clinton administration , where he held an assistant secretary of defense position on international security .\nBefore serving as deputy secretary of defense from 2011 to 2013 , Mr. Carter served as an undersecretary of defense handling acquisitions , technology and logistics .\n\u201c He is immensely open and honest by virtue of his background in academia , [ and ] he welcomes an open , passionate debate on issues , \u201d said Sen. Richard Blumenthal , Connecticut Democrat , who sits on the committee that confirmed Mr. Carter .\nSen. Claire McCaskill , Missouri Democrat and also a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee , said that all the defense secretaries she \u2019 s worked with have been \u201c very honest with me , \u201d but that she is \u201c partial \u201d to Mr. Carter because of his commitment to reform contracting procedures in order to eliminate waste .\n\u201c His background is as a geeky nerd [ who ] really has been in the weeds on contracting , and that \u2019 s been an area that I have been relentless about , \u201d she said . \u201c Ash Carter is probably the first defense secretary in history that has such a strong working knowledge in that area , so I \u2019 m a big fan because of that . \u201d\nMr. Carter \u2019 s candid critique of Iraqi troops at Ramadi is nothing but 12 years of frustration at the Iraqis \u2019 inability to step up finally bubbling over , said P.J . Crowley , a former State Department spokesman .\n\u201c Ultimately the quality of the security forces \u2014 how well they \u2019 re led and how well the Baghdad government is able to regain over time the trust of the Sunni community in Iraq \u2014 these are things that the Iraqis have to do , \u201d said Mr. Crowley , who currently serves as a distinguished fellow at George Washington University . \u201c The circumstances in Ramadi where the Iraqi Security Forces retreated , despite outnumbering the aggressors , I \u2019 m certainly not surprised that Secretary Carter would be frustrated and would express that frustration . \u201d\nStill , Mr. Carter hasn \u2019 t been a thorn in the side of the administration in all matters .\nDuring his confirmation hearing he assured lawmakers he would not allow the White House to bully him into rapidly closing the U.S. military detention center at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .\nHowever , last week he told reporters he was working with the White House to submit a plan to close the center .\n\u201c With respect to [ Guantanamo ] , I \u2019 m working with the White House to prepare a plan , which we \u2019 ll then submit , per longstanding request , to Congress , \u201d Mr. Carter told reporters , according to a report by Defense One . \u201c My own view is this is a very constructive step . It \u2019 s important to see if we can find a way forward from this that is widely shared enough that we can actually get it done , and so I think it \u2019 s a good opportunity , and we \u2019 ll certainly follow through on that . \u201d","bias":2}

{"id":"4YAehOZS9ktKwLsv","content":"( CNN ) \u2013 President Barack Obama is n't looking to change current federal laws dictating the classification of marijuana , his spokesman explained Wednesday .\nJosh Earnest , the deputy press secretary , said Obama `` does not , at this point , advocate a change in the law '' that places marijuana in the same class of drugs as heroin , ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms , and which deems cannabis to have no medical use .\nResponding to a question from CNN Chief White House Correspondent Jessica Yellin , Earnest described the Obama administration 's position on marijuana as mainly focused on prosecuting drug traffickers rather than individual users .\n`` The administration 's position on this has been clear and consistent for some time now , '' he said . `` While the prosecution of drug traffickers remains an important priority , the president and the administration believe that the targeting of individual marijuana users , especially those with serious illnesses and their caregivers , is not the best allocation of federal law enforcement resources . ''\nA day earlier , Earnest said he could n't say whether or not the president 's personal views on medical marijuana had changed as he had not seen a column and documentary written by CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta , which detailed Gupta 's own shift on the issue .\nObama considered naming Gupta as surgeon general in 2009 , but the neurosurgeon later said he withdrew his name so he could maintain his surgical career and continue spending time with his family .\nGupta 's online essay on marijuana , published August 9 , was titled `` Why I changed my mind on weed . '' In it , he described changing his own stance on medical marijuana after researching the topic for his CNN documentary `` Weed . ''\nHe also apologized for what he said was his misguided previous stance .\n`` I apologize because I did n't look hard enough , until now , '' Gupta wrote . `` I did n't look far enough . I did n't review papers from smaller labs in other countries doing some remarkable research , and I was too dismissive of the loud chorus of legitimate patients whose symptoms improved on cannabis . ''\nObama last weighed in on the use of marijuana after two states \u2013 Washington and Colorado \u2013 legalized the recreational use of the drug .\n`` This is a tough problem , because Congress has not yet changed the law , '' Obama told Barbara Walters of ABC News . `` I head up the executive branch ; we 're supposed to be carrying out laws .

Trump argued there was a double standard when it came to his tax returns and Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton \u2019 s emails .\nHowever , as Stephanopoulos continued to press Trump on the issue , Trump fired back by pointing out Stephanopoulos \u2019 prior relationship with the Bill and Hillary Clinton and noted it was something he didn \u2019 t reveal .\nSTEPHANOPOULOS : Let \u2019 s talk about your tax return . Under new pressure from the Clinton campaign , Secretary Clinton talking about that the last couple of days . I just have a bottom line question for you . Yes or no , do you believe voters have a right to see your tax returns before they make a final decision ?\nTRUMP : I don \u2019 t think they do . But I do say this , I will really gladly give them \u2014 not going to learn anything but it \u2019 s under routine audit . When the audit ends I \u2019 ll present them . That should be before the election . I hope it \u2019 s before the election . But when the audit ends I \u2019 ve had even journalists say that , no , nobody should give until audits are over and have had journalists say that . So I think if there \u2019 s no \u2014 I sort of have to laugh when Clinton says it , Mrs. Clinton said I should give my tax what about all the emails or missing Goldman Sachs speeches . When is she going to give that ? Very great hypocrite but as far as I \u2019 m concerned I want to give it as soon as possible , as soon as the audit every year \u2014 I have wealthy friends that never get audited .\nSTEPHANOPOULOS : As you know the audit is no excuse . The IRS has made it very clear an audit is not a bar to public release . It is entirely your choice . President Nixon released his tax returns even though he was under audit . And when you were seeking a casino license in Pennsylvania and New Jersey , you released the returns to the state officials even though you were under audit .\nTRUMP : I am under audit now and as soon as the audit ends I \u2019 ll release my returns . If you look at many others , many others feel the same way and almost every lawyer will tell you the same thing \u2013when you \u2019 re under audit you finish the audit before you release . I have no problem and it should be and I hope it \u2019 s before the election .\nTRUMP : By the way , people will learn nothing . I put in financials 100 pages worth of financials that show that I built a company that \u2019 s worth more than $ 10 billion . It shows cash . It shows cash flows . Returns but nevertheless , when the audit is complete , i will release . I have no problem with it .\nSTEPHANOPOULOS : A couple of follow-ups to that . If you are willing to release your tax returns to get a casino license , why shouldn \u2019 t voters see them before they make you commander in chief ?\nTRUMP : well , because at the time it didn \u2019 t make a ny if you take a look at the picture that we sent you with a tax returns probably ten feet high when you stack them on top and lengthy and complex . I built a massive business and want to make sure that everything is perfect . It a routine audit and get through it first and that \u2019 s what I \u2019 ll do . There have been many presidents that have not shown their tax returns .\nTRUMP : Before 1976 , people didn \u2019 t do it . It used to be a secret thing . I don \u2019 t want it to be secret , but I do want the audit to get finished .\nSTEPHANOPOULOS : Before that Richard Nixon released his returns as I said , but to get to your point on the one hand you show that stack and on the other hand you say people can \u2019 t learn anything . They can actually learn quite a lot . They can learn your sources of income . They can learn whether you have any foreign sources of income or any Swiss bank accounts or other offshore accounts . Do you ?\nTRUMP : I tell you right now , I do not . I do not have Swiss bank accounts . I don \u2019 t have offshore \u2014 I really have a very , very clean company . And believe me , if i didn \u2019 t , it would have been reported by 200 groups because there \u2019 s nobody that has more reporting or more scrutiny than I have . I have given my financials , they \u2019 re extraordinary . And we would have read if they weren \u2019 t . But believe me when i release my financial , George and sent them down to Federal Elections , there was a feeding frenzy by the media and they reported , wow , that is a great company and I have built a great , great company and by the way , when you look at numbers , when you look at incomes , when you look at all of the things or most of the things you talked about that \u2019 s reported on the financials .\nSTEPHANOPOULOS : It \u2019 s not reported on the financials . What they don \u2019 t know also is your tax rate . they don \u2019 t show whether you paid a low \u2013\nTRUMP : I try very hard to pay as little tax as possible and have said that for the last two years . I fight very hard because this country wastes our money . They take our tax money and throw it down the drain . They spend $ 4 trillion in the Middle East and we can \u2019 t fix a road or a bridge . And I fight very hard . I consider it an expense because , frankly , our country doesn \u2019 t know what they \u2019 re doing with our money or tax money and that \u2019 s part of the problem . So I fight very hard to pay as little tax as possible .\nTRUMP : It \u2019 s none of your business . You \u2019 ll see it when I release but I fight very hard to pay as little tax as possible .\nSTEPHANOPOULOS : You know , we \u2019 ve talked about this several times over the last several years . I first asked about it in 2011 . You said you would release your tax returns then thinking of running for president when President Obama releases his birth certificate . He did . Then you said you would release your tax returns when Secretary Clinton releases her emails . She has turned over all emails in her possession .\nTRUMP : There \u2019 s plenty of missing .

{"id":"4BGi6MqX76uRG1Uy","content":"President Trump declared on Twitter Wednesday that James Comey `` totally protected Hillary Clinton , '' after the FBI confirmed the former bureau boss drafted a statement on the private email case two months before it was over .\nIn a series of tweets , Trump also swiped at the Justice Department , seeming to suggest they review what he called an apparent `` fix . ''\n\u201c Wow , FBI confirms report that James Comey drafted letter exonerating Crooked Hillary Clinton long before investigation was complete , \u201d Trump tweeted . \u201c Many people not interviewed , including Hillary Clinton herself .

Where is Justice Dept ? \u201d\nHe followed up : `` As it has turned out , James Comey lied and leaked and totally protected Hillary Clinton . He was the best thing that ever happened to her ! ''\nThe flurry of tweets was in reference to the FBI releasing documents this week that prove Comey began drafting a statement regarding the Clinton email investigation months before he interviewed her and other key witnesses . The document release was titled \u201c Drafts of Director Comeys July 5 , 2016 Statement Regarding Email Server Investigation Part 01 of 01 . \u201d\nThe release bolstered critics ' claims that Comey was drafting an `` exoneration statement '' well before ending the case and recommending against criminal charges .\nThe contents of the newly released emails , however , were largely unclear as the majority of the document was redacted . The records , that are now public , show the email titled \u201c Midyear Exam\u2014UNCLASSIFIED \u201d was sent by Comey on May 2 , 2016 to FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe , General Counsel James Baker and James Rybicki , chief of staff and senior counselor .\nTrump 's Wednesday challenge to the Justice Department regarding the matter was a throwback to his summer criticism of the nation 's top law enforcement official , Attorney General Jeff Sessions . While Trump had been at odds with one of his earliest supporters over the decision to recuse in the Russia probe , Trump in recent weeks has dialed down that criticism .\nThe existence of the Comey documents was first brought to light by Sen. Chuck Grassley , R-Iowa , chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , and Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-S.C. , after they reviewed transcripts with top Comey aides who alluded to the email \u2019 s existence .\nThe Judiciary Committee penned a letter on Aug. 30 to newly appointed FBI Director Christopher Wray noting their findings , saying that \u201c it appears that in April or early May of 2016 , Mr. Comey had already decided he would issue a statement exonerating Secretary Clinton . That was long before FBI agents finished their work . \u201d\n\u201c The outcome of an investigation should not be prejudged while FBI agents are still hard at work trying to gather the facts , \u201d the letter stated .\nThe existence of these documents raised questions over Comey \u2019 s June 2017 Senate testimony regarding his decision to go public with findings in the Clinton email investigation . Comey noted former Attorney General Loretta Lynch \u2019 s involvement in the probe , including her controversial meeting with former President Bill Clinton days before his wife was interviewed .\nJUDICIAL WATCH SAYS FBI HAS FOUND CLINTON-LYNCH TARMAC MEETING DOCUMENTS\nLast week , the FBI said it uncovered 30 pages of documents related to that controversial 2016 tarmac meeting .","bias":2}

Obama tries to shore up female vote\nPresident Barack Obama once held such a dominant lead among women that top conservatives warned Mitt Romney not to waste much time targeting them .\nThe president \u2019 s sudden slide among women after that revealed just how fluid their support truly was \u2014 and it \u2019 s forced Obama and his Democratic allies to spend the final days of the campaign fortifying what had appeared to be an indestructible female firewall .\nTo win reelection , Obama needs big margins among women . But a spate of national polls , and even some battleground state surveys , shows his robust leads have slipped away . The challenges after the first debate have remained for Obama as Romney continues to reshape his candidacy with a more moderate message on foreign policy , abortion and taxes .\nNobody expects Obama to actually lose the women \u2019 s vote , and many Democratic strategists argue that Obama \u2019 s overwhelming lead after the conventions and at the height of the contraception battles last spring was never sustainable . But Obama \u2019 s new vulnerability among female voters gives fresh urgency to the latest war-on-women attacks , sparked by Indiana GOP Senate candidate Richard Mourdock \u2019 s comments about pregnancy and rape .\n\u201c I was surprised women would be as open to Romney as they were [ after the first debate ] , and it was a warning to all of us , \u201d said Celinda Lake , a Democratic pollster who specializes in framing issues to women voters . \u201c The warning was that women had not written Romney off , and we had to speak to them and draw clear contrasts until the last day of the campaign . \u201d\nThat \u2019 s why the Mourdock controversy came at just the right time for Obama , giving him a late-in-the-game opportunity to recast Romney as an extremist on women \u2019 s issues .\nDemocrats down the line \u2014 from Obama himself to the Democratic National Committee , lawmakers and women \u2019 s groups \u2014 and even some Republicans , including 2008 GOP presidential nominee John McCain , condemned the Mourdock remark that pregnancy is intended by God even when caused by rape .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t know how these guys come up with these ideas , \u201d Obama said Wednesday on NBC \u2019 s \u201c The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. \u201d \u201c Let me make a very simple proposition : Rape is rape .

{"id":"MT8haNXq6WUMiYFI","content":"ATLANTA \u2013 The Atlanta police chief stepped down Saturday in the wake of the death of a 27-year-old Black man who was shot by an officer while fleeing during a struggle at a Wendy 's drive-thru late Friday night , according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation . Hours later , police and National Guards troops clashed with protesters outside the fast-food restaurant .\nRayshard Brooks had been asleep in his car at the drive-thru , causing other customers to drive around the car , the Bureau of Investigation said . Police were dispatched to the Wendy 's around 10:30 p.m. , and conducted a sobriety test on Brooks , who failed the test , according to the officials .\n`` During the arrest , the male subject resisted and a struggle ensued , '' the Bureau of Investigation said . `` The officer deployed a Taser . Witnesses report that during the struggle the male subject grabbed and was in possession of the Taser . It has also been reported that the male subject was shot by an officer in the struggle over the Taser . ''\nOne officer was treated for an injury and discharged after the confrontation . Brooks died in the hospital after surgery .\nPolice Chief Erika Shields is immediately stepping down after the shooting , Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced in a news conference Saturday afternoon . She also called for the termination of the police officer who shot Brooks and for another officer to be placed on administrative duty .\n`` While there may be debate as to whether this was an appropriate use of deadly force , I firmly believe that there is a clear distinction between what you can do and what you should do . I do not believe that this was a justified use of deadly force , '' Bottoms said .\nBottoms said Shields would continue in a different role `` to be determined '' in the police department .\n`` To the family of Mr. Brooks , there are no words strong enough to express how sincerely sorry I am for your loss . I do hope that you will find some comfort in the swift actions that have been taken today , '' she said .\nBottoms called Shields a `` solid member of APD for over two decades . ''\n`` And because of her desire that Atlanta be a model of what meaningful reform should look like across this country , Chief Shields has offered to immediately step aside as police chief so that the city may move forward with urgency in rebuilding the trust so desperately needed throughout our community , '' Bottoms said .\nOn Saturday night , several hundred people gathered in the parking lot of the Wendy \u2019 s where Brooks encountered the police . Some chanted `` say his name '' and carried signs that read `` He didn \u2019 t deserve to die '' and `` convict the killer cop . '' The restaurant was closed to patrons .\nTyler Brown , 29 , said he was one of the first protesters to arrive at Wendy \u2019 s Saturday morning after learning about Brooks \u2019 death on social media . Brown , who lives just a few blocks away , said , the community is baffled at why the the officer felt the need to kill Brooks .\n\u201c Honestly I \u2019 m tired of it , \u201d Brown said . \u201c No matter what you do , you \u2019 re unarmed , you \u2019 re not a threat , you \u2019 re down on the ground in handcuffs , and they still feel the need to put the knee on your neck or shoot you . \u201d\nKayla Pruitt , 24 , of Atlanta , said the cries from protesters in recent weeks seem to have fallen on deaf ears with police .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve been out here for a couple weeks now and y \u2019 all still killing folks , \u201d said Pruitt , who arrived Saturday at the Wendy 's to protest police violence . \u201c It \u2019 s like have y \u2019 all heard nothing anybody has said ? \u201d\nThe peaceful protest suddenly turned violent around 8:30 p.m. after National Guard troops arrived toting guns . Some protesters began surrounding one police car and rocking it . Other protesters surged on the police and troops without touching them , forcing the law enforcement officials to walk backwards from the crowd . After a few minutes , the law enforcement officials released several canisters of tear gas into the crowd , sending the protesters fleeing in panic .\nProtesters later shut down an interstate highway in both directions and set fire to the Wendy \u2019 s restaurant where Brooks was fatally shot the night before .\nIt 's unclear why Brooks was sleeping in his car at the drive-thru Friday night .\nWendy \u2019 s surveillance video published by the Bureau of Investigations Saturday afternoon appears to show officers arriving in a vehicle to the drive-thru parking lot . The vehicle can be seen pulling up to another car , but the officers and Brooks can not be seen in the video .\nAbout half an hour later , Brooks can be seen running away from two officers , who chase after him . As Brooks runs away , he turns back toward one officer and points the Taser , and that officer fires his weapon . Brooks falls to the ground and appears to remain motionless .\nAs the two officers approach Brooks on the ground , bystanders can be seen getting out of their cars and recording video .\nGeorgia Bureau of Investigation Director Vic Reynolds said Saturday afternoon the agency had gathered surveillance video from the Wendy 's , police body cam video and bystander video posted to social media . The agency had spoken with at least one witness , who corroborated the videos , Reynolds said .\n`` It does appear in the video that he is fleeing from the Atlanta police officers , '' Reynolds said .\nReynolds said he not sure how many shots were fired . He did not comment on whether the officer 's use of force was appropriate .\n`` We have not digitally enhanced that video yet . We will , '' Reynolds said .\nFulton County District Attorney Paul Howard , Jr. said in a statement Saturday that his office had launched an `` intense , independent '' investigation of the incident , and that members of his office were on the scene shortly after the shooting .\n`` Our thoughts and our sympathies are extended to the family of Rayshard Brooks as we must not forget that this investigation is centered upon a loss of life , '' Howard said .\nBystander video of Brooks ' encounter with the police began to circulate on social media Friday night . \u2588\u2588\u2588 could not independently verify the video .\nBrooks ' death comes amid thousands of protests worldwide against police killings of Black people following the death of George Floyd , a Black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer held his knee into Floyd 's neck for more than eight minutes on Memorial Day .\nIn a statement Saturday , the Georgia NAACP called for Shields and Bottoms to be held `` accountable for the continued threat on innocent Black lives in their community . ''\n`` Atlantans woke up to disturbing videos and reports of Rayshard being killed by the Atlanta Police Department . At this time , we must address the over-saturated police presence in Atlanta \u2019 s Black communities . This is not the first time a Black man was killed for sleeping , '' the organization said in a statement . `` The City of Atlanta must address this not only with their words , but also with their actions and budgetary decisions . ''\nStacey Abrams , a former Democratic gubernatorial candidate in Georgia , condemned the shooting on Twitter Saturday morning .\n`` The killing of # RayshardBrooks in Atlanta last night demands we severely restrict the use of deadly force . Yes , investigations must be called for \u2013 but so too should accountability , '' Abrams wrote . `` Sleeping in a drive-thru must not end in death . ''\nBernice King , the daughter of Martin Luther King , Jr. , said on Twitter that Brooks ' death `` reflects that low to no value was placed on his life . ''\n`` Bottom line : # RayshardBrooks should be alive , '' she wrote . `` Rayshard \u2019 s life shouldn \u2019 t have even been endangered by a call to police because he was sleeping in his car in a drive thru . I \u2019 m learning more and talking with community . ''\nOutside the Wendy 's , Jonte Trotter said he traveled to Atlanta from Oakland , California , earlier this week to join the ongoing protests here . He said he was frustrated that police officers continue to use unnecessary force on Black men .\n\u201c It just shows that as a Black man myself , my life holds no value , \u201d said Trotter , 23 , before police began clashing with the crowd . \u201c I can be killed at any time and it will be another hashtag , another protest . There \u2019 s no automatic justice over my life . \u201d\nOfficials in Georgia have also attracted scrutiny in recent months for their handling of the killing of Ahmaud Arbery . In February , 25-year-old Arbery , who was Black , was fatally shot by three white men while out jogging about two miles from his home in a neighborhood outside Brunswick , Georgia . It took more than two months for murder charges and arrests in Arbery 's case , which was eventually handed over to the Georgia Bureau of Investigations .\n`` I was just thinking ironically it was about a month or so ago I stood in front of you upstairs as the GBI got involved in the Arbery matter down in Brunswick , '' Reynolds said Saturday . `` As with the Arbery matter in Brunswick , we will ask again for the community \u2019 s patience . ''\nIn all , the bureau has investigated 48 officer-involved shootings this year , Nelly Miles , a bureau spokesperson , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nIbram X. Kendi , whose book \u201c How to Be an Antiracist \u201d hit No . 1 on the hardcover nonfiction list after Floyd 's death as Americans sought to educate themselves about the nation 's racist systems , tweeted that Brooks should not be blamed for his death .\n`` I suspect racist Americans will argue # RayshardBrooks should n't have ran ; he made the officers fear for their lives ; his unarmed back threatened them ; so they had to shoot him in the back . Or , we 'll hear about apples when another murderous tree has fallen , '' he said .\nFormer Police Chief Erika Shields released a statement Saturday offering her `` deep and abiding love '' for Atlanta .\n`` I have faith in the mayor , and it is time for the city to move forward and build trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve , '' she said .\nAtlanta Police Deputy Chief Rodney Bryant will serve as the interim chief , Bottoms said .","bias":1}
{"id":"DM82yNBVQpguOdSq","content":"On April 15 , 2019 , just before 18:20 CEST , a structure fire broke out beneath the roof of Notre-Dame Cathedral , Paris . By the time it was extinguished , some 15 hours later , the building \u2019 s spire and most of its roof had been destroyed . Though its upper walls were severely damaged , extensive damage to the interior was prevented by its stone vaulted ceiling , which played a significant role in containing the burning roof as it collapsed . Numerous works of art and other treasures were evacuated early in the emergency ; nevertheless , many other masterpieces were damaged or destroyed . The outpouring of grief from around the world when Notre Dame erupted into flames quickly turned into a resolve to rebuild \u2014 and by the 18th of April , just three days after the fire started , crowdfunding efforts to help repair the damage had surpassed the $ 1 billion mark .\nOn the 21st of April , 2019 , a series of coordinated terrorist attacks took place in Sri Lanka . Three Christian churches across the land as well as three luxury hotels in the commercial capital Colombo were targeted in a series of coordinated attacks . At least 321 people were killed , including 39 foreign nationals and three police officers ; at least 500 were injured in the bombings . At the time of writing this \u2014 April 24 \u2014 not a single significant crowdfunding effort exists .\nFor over 800 years , Notre Dame has been a symbol of France \u2019 s history , both in a literal and metaphorical sense . The eerie construction has served as the scene of major events in history , and as a haven of inestimable heritage . However , even if we exhaust the English language by paying homage to the Gothic structure in a whole host of ways , Notre Dame is just a building . A building of great prestige , I concede . Nevertheless , it is just a building .\nIn Sri Lanka , people died , hundreds of them , and the world barely blinked . Why ?\nWe live in a consumer culture , one built on a foundation of things .\nOur entire economic and social system appears to revolves around the notion of aspirational acquisitions\u2014 the idea that a better \u2018 you \u2019 can be bought . It doesn \u2019 t really matter what you buy . It can be a new car or a new coffee machine . Just buy . Don \u2019 t have the cash ? It doesn \u2019 t matter ; just stick it on the credit card . Modern society appears to rests on the notion that , no matter what , acquiring things is all that really matters . Eat , sleep , buy , repeat .\nIs it an exaggeration to think that millions of us love things \u2014 like our smartphones \u2014 more than actual people ?\nI don \u2019 t think so . Consumerism is a transcendent religion . Apple and Amazon are the Gods we bow to . By focusing individuals on the deification of consumption , consumer culture fosters narcissistic personalities and behaviors .\nNarcissists generally display high levels of arrogance ; they are deeply concerned with issues of personal competence , the pursuit of power and prestige , often to compensate for feelings of inner emptiness and diminished self-worth .\nThe desire for external validation is totally compatible with the idea of materialistic wealth , as both are heavily motivated by the praise of others . In fact , research suggests that materialistic values are fueled by feelings of insecurity . A 2002 study published in the journal Psychology and Marketing found that those who regularly doubt themselves and their own self-worth tend to be more acquisitive .\nConsumerism capitalizes on an individual \u2019 s insecurities . It leads society down a path that equates purchases with the idea of self- improvement and social mobility . As a dynamic cultural force , consumerism appeals to us at a base level . Want a better life ? Want more respect ? Want more friends ? Well , material possesions can help .\nThis brings me back to Notre Dame , which was and still is a material possession . State owned , the now badly damaged building is just another thing . A notable thing , but still just a thing . Again , hundreds of people died in Sri Lanka \u2014 people , not things . Why are so many quick to lament the loss of a building but not the loss of life ?\nSadly , although we view ourselves as distinct individuals , we tend to view the world through the one lens . When a tragedy occurs in a developed and \u201c attractive \u201d country like France , people see this as a serious threat to their lifestyles and values . However , when tragedy strikes in a less \u201c attractive \u201d country , even a tragedy as immense as the one that took place in Sri Lanka , amidst the sighing and virtue signaling , we think to ourselves , \u201c well , this is what happens in a country like ______. \u201d Countries like Iraq , Afghanistan , Syria , Somalia , Venezuela , Pakistan , as well as Sri Lanka , just aren \u2019 t as sexy as a country like France . Sadly , this is how many of us view the world , weighing up the cultural significance of a land and its people before deciding how much compassion we should display .\nThe world in which we inhabit helps foster narcissistic tendencies . Spoiler alert : Narcissism is not compatible with empathy . People who score high on tests for narcissism consistently show deficits in empathy , and vice versa .\nNarcissists adore the limelight , and a great tragedy can serve as a canvas onto which they project their narcissism .\nIs it just me , or did you also happen to notice the following : shortly after the blaze in Paris , social media was also ablaze with individuals posting photos of themselves standing outside Notre Dame . \u201c So glad to have visited this great place before all was lost , \u201d read one of my friend \u2019 s posts on Facebook . Another read , \u201c Notre Dame , forever in my heart . My boyfriend and I visited last year. \u201d The way in which people rush to superimpose themselves on history never fails to surprise me . This was narcissism masquerading as compassion , where people , consciously or unconsciously , used a genuine tragedy to gain social capital .\nYes , but so many people have been to Paris , so many have visited Notre Dame ( as evidenced by the amount of photos posted ) ; Sri Lanka , on the other hand\u2026 not so much . Really , that \u2019 s the logic , or lack thereof , that we are willing to employ ?","bias":2}
{"id":"pv6GnAKBJKwDRh0f","content":"Right-wing activist group Project Veritas published an article Wednesday that claimed \u201c A CBS News crew pulled medical professionals off the floor at the Cherry Medical Center in Grand Rapids , Michigan , to line up in their vehicles so a CBS film crew would have a long line for their COVID-19 coverage. \u201d The story quickly went viral on Twitter .\nIt was also picked up by outlets including the Wall Street Journal , The Daily Beast , and entertainment news website Deadline .\nIn a video that accompanies the Project Veritas article , Project Veritas founder James O \u2019 Keefe states : \u201c An insider has come to us from a Grand Rapids medical center and they claim that CBS News created a fake COVID testing line , taking away doctors and medical personnel away ( sic ) from treating patients just to create a fake , staged event just for CBS news and their national morning show . \u201d\nCBS issued a statement in response , denying its news crew had any part in orchestrating the line and placing the blame on Cherry Health :\n\u201c CBS News did not stage anything at the Cherry Health facility . Any suggestion to the contrary is 100 % false . These allegations are alarming . We reached out to Cherry Health to address them immediately . They informed us for the first time that one of their chief officers told at least one staffer to get in the testing line along with real patients . No one from CBS News had any knowledge of this before tonight . They also said that their actions did not prevent any actual patients from being tested . We take the accuracy of our reporting very seriously and we are removing the Cherry Health portion from the piece . \u201d\nThe statement was included in the original article , published on May 6 , but was framed as a `` BREAKING '' update by O \u2019 Keefe , who claimed the statement came \u201c in response \u201d to the article . The article specifically about CBS ' statement on Project Veritas \u2019 website notes that the statement was delivered to Project Veritas on May 5 , a day before publication .\nThe insider \u2019 s identity and role at the facility were not revealed by Project Veritas , but in his interview with O \u2019 Keefe , the insider reveals that he grew suspicious after witnessing the alleged staging , but had no direct knowledge of who was responsible . Only one person in the hidden footage mentions CBS , saying \u201c apparently the news crew wanted more people in the line. \u201d The basis for this claim is never explored and other employees of Cherry Health were caught on camera putting the blame not on CBS but on Cherry Health \u2019 s director of quality and information .\nA representative from CBS reiterated the statement provided to Project Veritas when contacted by \u2588\u2588\u2588 Fact Check . In a statement provided to \u2588\u2588\u2588 Fact Check by a representative of Cherry Health Medical Center via email , Cherry Health CEO Tasha Blackman concurred that , to her knowledge , \u201c CBS This Morning did not stage any part of their visit to our site. \u201d Blackman also denied that she had instructed staff to get into the line , but when asked if that was true of other members of Cherry Health \u2019 s leadership team as well , Blackman stated :\n\u201c I was not aware of any staging that took place . Cherry Health has had a process of pre-screening individuals for COVID-19 testing . On the day of the CBS interview we had 34 prescreened individuals that came for testing . I was not asked for help on any staging , nor was I aware that any staging activities were going on . The only requests we had were tied to the number of patients being tested that day and the PPE supply that we had in place . \u201d\nIt seems some staging took place at Cherry Health during filming for the CBS news segment , but given the statements by the parties involved and O \u2019 Keefe \u2019 s history of misleadingly editing videos , Project Veritas \u2019 presentation of events deserves a healthy dose of skepticism .","bias":2}

This trade pact `` is good for America , '' he added .\nThe biggest loser would be manufacturing , natural resources and energy , which would be down by a collective $ 10 billion , or 0.1 percent , after 15 years , the ITC said .\nCongress asked the independent federal agency to assess the economic impact of the proposed trade deal involving the United States and 11 other countries .\nPresident Obama strongly supports the pact and signed it in February . But the deal is on ice without congressional approval . At this time , no action is planned on Capitol Hill .\nNext week , Obama will be visiting Vietnam and Japan , where he will highlight his support for an economic partnership with those two countries , along with Malaysia , Singapore , Brunei , Australia , New Zealand , Canada , Mexico , Chile and Peru .\nThe deal is intended to open markets for U.S. exporters and farmers , and help protect intellectual property . And it is supposed to strengthen the U.S. political position in Asia .\n`` TPP allows America \u2013 and not countries like China \u2013 to write the rules of the road in the 21st century , which is especially important in a region as dynamic as the Asia-Pacific , '' Obama said at the time of the signing .\nIn general , most economists say TPP would help more than harm the U.S. economy .\nBut Lori Wallach of Public Citizen says the new report shows the pact could have disastrous effects .\n`` This report spotlights how damaging the TPP would be for most Americans ' jobs and wages given it concludes 16 out of 25 U.S. economic sectors ( in selected sectors in agriculture , manufacturing , and services ) would suffer losses while the `` upside '' projection is miniscule gains in economic growth despite these findings being based on the same widely criticized methodology and unrealistic assumptions that have resulted in past USITC reports systematically overstating the benefits from trade deals that ended up causing serious damage . ''\nLast year , Public Citizen said trade deals `` have failed to meet their corporate and political backers ' glowing promises of job creation . ''\nBut the ITC report on NAFTA issued in January , 1993 , predicted only modest gains . It said the `` estimated long-term gains in U.S. and Canadian real GDP are 0.5 percent or less . ''\nIn the post-World War II era , the U.S. economy has average 3.21 percent annual GDP growth rate .\nFor the 20th anniversary of NAFTA 's implementation , the Congressional Research Service found this : `` In reality , NAFTA did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters . The net overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest . ''\nBut whether this new TPP forecast will turn out to be right wo n't be known for a long time . The proposed trade deal `` will come into effect anywhere from five to maybe 30 years from now , '' Brandeis Professor Peter Petri said at the White House briefing earlier in the week . `` It 's basically a long-term gradual transition in which very small changes will be made along the way , up as long as 30 years in the future . ''\nTrade has become a central issue in this year 's election cycle . For example , Republican Donald Trump has called TPP `` a horrible deal , '' while Bernie Sanders , running for the Democratic nomination , regularly refers to trade deals as disasters .","bias":1}

{"id":"PIUcQVOlKBNfI0AC","content":"Yesterday , the US Supreme Court granted the federal government \u2019 s emergency request to stay an injunction in an Illinois case about the \u201c public charge \u201d rule in immigration . The order came with no explanation from most\u2014not those in favor or opposed\u2014just a vote count and a a damning dissent ( pdf ) from justice Sonia Sotomayor .\nThe five conservatives on the bench approved the government \u2019 s request and the four progressives voted no . Sotomayor accused her colleagues in the majority of undermining fairness and process by continually granting the Trump administration \u2019 s allegedly urgent demands .\n\u201c Claiming one emergency after another , the Government has recently sought stays in an unprecedented number of cases , demanding immediate attention and consuming limited Court resources in each . And with each successive application , of course , its cries of urgency ring increasingly hollow , \u201d Sotomayor writes .\nBut the disingenuous alarm isn \u2019 t what bothers her most . \u201c Perhaps most troublingly , the Court \u2019 s recent behavior on stay applications has benefited one litigant over all others , \u201d she notes .\nThat litigant is the federal government under president Donald Trump . Though she didn \u2019 t name the president in her dissent , the justice is clearly unimpressed with the Trump administration \u2019 s exceptional neediness , and even less taken with her colleagues \u2019 willingness to be its supreme enforcers .\nIt \u2019 s not the first time Sotomayor has complained about the administration \u2019 s reliance on emergency action , and she \u2019 s not alone in seeing a disturbing practice emerging .\nUniversity of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck wrote in the Harvard Law Review last year about the high court \u2019 s unusually active \u201c shadow docket. \u201d The federal government now turns to the justices for emergency relief , circumventing the usual appellate process , more than ever before . It doesn \u2019 t wait for lower courts to decide matters but goes straight to the top , claiming extraordinary needs\u2014often with little supporting evidence\u2014and has created this alternate docket , a shadow caseload the high court continually considers prematurely .\nDuring the first 30 months of the Trump administration , the government sought emergency or extraordinary relief from the Supreme Court with \u201c unprecedented frequency , \u201d Vladeck argues . It applied for at least 20 emergency stays , filed petitions for review before judgment in nine cases , and sought writs of mandamus against three judges . That \u2019 s a stark contrast to the past 16 years , during which the government sought only eight stays total , four reviews before judgment , and no mandamus writs .\nVladeck , like Sotomayor , partly blames the court for the uptick in action . \u201c [ T ] he Justices have largely acquiesced in the [ government \u2019 s ] newfound aggressiveness , \u201d the professor writes . He argues that the justices mostly now seem to go with the government \u2019 s contention that it suffers irreparable harm from lower court rulings without attempting to measure actual likely damage . That \u2019 s precisely Sotomayor \u2019 s complaint in the latest case .\nThe professor , unlike the justice , however , also puts the people at fault . He says the public \u2019 s indifference to the additional activity is problematic . The emergency requests are granted and denied with great consequences , little notice , and \u201c no public opprobrium . \u201d\nUltimately , all of this extraordinary action on behalf of the government by the highest court in the land undermines a central premise of the American legal system\u2014that all litigants come as equals and can expect the same process , and consideration , whoever they may be . It \u2019 s merely an ideal , of course , but even concepts can erode . Sotomayor believes that is what \u2019 s happening now .\nShe condemns colleagues on the bench who are more susceptible to continual calls from the government about irreparable harm warranting emergency relief than they are to cries for help from prisoners being put to death . \u201c This Court often permits executions\u2014where the risk of irreparable harm is the loss of life , \u201d the justice writes .\nYet here , where the government didn \u2019 t prove any harm would come from waiting for a lower court \u2019 s decision , and there \u2019 s less than a week to wait , the high court stepped in to answer the administration \u2019 s pleas for extraordinary relief .\nYesterday \u2019 s order stems from an Illinois court , which halted application of the updated \u201c public charge \u201d rule in that state pending litigation . The government \u2019 s new reading of this longstanding rule requires officials to consider an immigrant \u2019 s self-sufficiency and the likelihood they will become a burden by assessing reliance on any and all government benefits . Previously only monetary assistance was a mitigating factor .\nThe updated rule was challenged in courts around the country . A New York matter yielded a nationwide injunction barring its application while that case was pending . But two federal appeals courts declined to block it . The Trump administration thus challenged the New York court \u2019 s expansive stay in an emergency request to the high court , and the justices in a 5-4 vote granted it last month .\nThat means the new public charge rule goes into effect everywhere but Illinois in the coming week , just as the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals considers the Illinois injunction specifically . Sotomayor doesn \u2019 t see why the new grant was warranted under the circumstances . \u201d The Government \u2019 s only claimed hardship is that it must enforce an existing interpretation of an immigration rule in one State\u2014just as it has done for the past 20 years\u2014while an updated version of the rule takes effect in the remaining 49 . The Government has not quantified or explained any burdens that would arise from this state of the world , \u201d she writes .\nSotomayor believes the emergency stays waste valuable time and resources on matters that are still being fleshed out in lower tribunals , eroding the whole appellate process . \u201c [ T ] he Court\u2014in this case , the New York cases , and many others\u2014has been all too quick to grant the Government \u2019 s reflexive requests . But make no mistake : Such a shift in the Court \u2019 s own behavior comes at a cost , \u201d the justice warns .","bias":1}

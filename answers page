## Inspiration
We were interested in the effect of propaganda on modern life and politics and wanted to develop a way for people to identify it more easily.

## What it does
ManipulAIte combines 3 machine learning models to detect 4 common signs of propaganda: illogical statements, contradictions, toxic or offensive language and excessively emotive language.

## How we built it
We used 3 different AI models from the website huggingface.co. With these models we then used github and our tech skills.

## Challenges we ran into
learning how to fine tune pretrained algorithms.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
finishing a website application that works correctly

## What we learned
how to tune pretrained models

## What's next for ManipulAIte
If we had more time we would expand our models and account for more manipulation techniques
